    "text": "Preface\n\nThis guide has been prepared by Ahpra in consultation with the National Boards (the Boards). It is intended\nto provide a decision-making framework for:\n- Decision-makers under the National Law;\n- health practitioners subject to a regulatory process, and their legal representatives;\n- notifiers and third parties that may become involved in the regulatory process\n(because they are a witness, or hold relevant information); and\n- the general public.\nThis guide does not constitute a code or guideline within the meaning of section 39 of the National Law and\nis intended to provide general information only. It does not constitute legal advice.\nPurpose and aims\nThe purpose of this guide is to set out how the Boards manage notifications about the health, performance\nand conduct of practitioners under Part 8 of the National Law. It aims to:\n- clearly and transparently convey how the health, performance and conduct schemes\nare administered by Ahpra and the Boards; and\n- provide general regulatory information to relevant tribunals and other decision-makers (such as\npanel members).\nGeneral limitations\nThis guide provides general guidance about key parts of Part 8 of the National Law as it applies uniformly\nin each jurisdiction (with the exception of New South Wales [NSW]). Accordingly, it does not address each\ndifference in the application of the National Law in each state and territory, although it does consider some\nmaterial differences.\nReferences to a 'practitioner' are, except where specified, intended to refer to a registered health practitioner\nin one of the 16 regulated health professions prescribed under the National Law.\nThis guide does not provide information about students registered under the National Law.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 6\n1. Introduction\n1.1 Background to the National Law\nThe Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (National Law) came into operation in each state and\nterritory in 2010. Before this, each state and territory individually regulated health practitioners, including\nmanaging complaints through their own statutory schemes. There were over 85 boards for health professions\nnationwide.\nIn 2008 the states and territories agreed, at a Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting, to\nestablish a National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS). This culminated in the development and\nimplementation of the National Law.\nThe National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS) was implemented through enacting the National\nLaw in each state and territory, using an ‘adoption of laws’ model. The Commonwealth did not need to pass\nlegislation for the scheme to be established.\nToday there are 15 National Boards that regulate the 16 health professions that fall under the  auspices of\nthe National Law:\n- Eleven professions – chiropractic, dental, medical, nursing, midwifery, optometry, osteopathy,\npharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry and psychology – were originally included for regulation in 2010.\n- Four professions – Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practice, Chinese medicine. medical\nradiation practice and occupational therapy – were added in 2012.\n- An additional profession, paramedicine, was added from 1 December 2018.\nThe National Law established the National Boards and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency\n(Ahpra). Their distinct roles are set out below.\n1.2 Objectives and operation of the National Law\nThe objectives and guiding principles of the National Law are set out in section 3 of the National Law.\nThe object of the National Law is to establish a national registration and accreditation scheme for the\nregulation of health practitioners and, where relevant, students. The specific objectives are:\n- to provide for the protection of the public by ensuring that only health practitioners who are suitably\ntrained and qualified to practise in a competent and ethical manner are registered;\n- to facilitate workforce mobility across Australia by reducing the administrative burden for health\npractitioners wishing to move between participating jurisdictions or to practise in more than one\nparticipating jurisdiction;\n- to facilitate the provision of high-quality education and training of health practitioners;\n- to facilitate the rigorous and responsive assessment of overseas-trained health practitioners;\n- to facilitate access to services provided by health practitioners in accordance with the public interest;\nand\n- to enable the continuous development of a flexible, responsive and sustainable Australian health\nworkforce and to enable innovation in the education of, and service delivery by, health practitioners.\nThe guiding principles of the scheme are that:\n- the scheme is to operate in a transparent, accountable, efficient, effective and fair way;\n- fees required to be paid under the scheme are to be reasonable having regard to the efficient and\neffective operation of the scheme; and\n- restrictions on the practice of a health profession are to be imposed under the scheme only if it is\nnecessary to ensure health services are provided safely and are of an appropriate quality.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 7\n1.3 Role of Ahpra and the National Boards\nRole of Ahpra and National Boards\nAhpra is established by Part 4 of the National Law. Its primary function is to provide administrative assistance\nand support to the Boards, and the Boards’ committees, in exercising their functions.\nThe Boards are established by Part 5 of the National Law and Part 2 of the National Law Regulation.\nThe functions of the Boards are set out in section 35 of the National Law. Relevant to this guide, and\nthe operation of Part 8 of the National Law, the functions of the Boards include:\n- to oversee the receipt, assessment and investigation of notifications about people who:\no are or were registered as health practitioners in the health profession under this Law or a\ncorresponding prior Act; or\no are students in the health profession;\n- to establish panels to conduct hearings about—\no health and performance and professional standards matters about people who are or\nwere registered in the health profession under this Law or a corresponding prior Act; and\no health matters about students registered by the Board;\n- to refer matters about health practitioners who are or were registered under this Law or a\ncorresponding prior Act to responsible tribunals for participating jurisdictions; and\n- to oversee the management of health practitioners and students registered in the hea lth profession,\nincluding monitoring conditions, undertaking and suspensions imposed on the registration of the\npractitioners or students.\nThe Boards and Ahpra adopt a risk-based approach to the regulation of health practitioners. When\nperforming their duties, the Boards (and their committees) and Ahpra identify the risks posed by the health,\nconduct and performance of health practitioners, consider the possible consequences of those risks and\nrespond accordingly.\nDelegation by a National Board\nUnder section 36 of the National Law, a Board may establish a state or territory board (or regional board) for\na participating jurisdiction (that is, state or territory). A state, territory or regional board operates as a\ncommittee of a Board. A Board may also establish other committees under clause 11 of Schedule 4 of the\nNational Law. This enables the Board to exercise its functions in the jurisdiction to provide an effective and\ntimely, and in the case of state /territory boards, a local response to health practitioners and other people in\nthe jurisdiction.\nUnder section 37 of the National Law, a Board may delegate any of its functions to:\n- a committee (including a state, territory or regional board);\n- Ahpra;\n- an Ahpra employee; or\n- a person engaged by Ahpra as a contractor.\nRegulatory decisions are commonly made by a State / Territory Board or a committee of a Board (in the\nname of the Board itself). For example, at the time of publishing this guide in 2020 the committees of a large\nBoard like the Medical Board of Australia include:\n- State/Territory Boards in each jurisdiction;\n- the Sexual Boundaries Notifications Committee (that operates nationally);\n- the Notifications Committee Assessment (that operates nationally);\n- at least one Notifications Committee in each jurisdiction (except NSW);\n- a Registration Committee in each jurisdiction; and\n- an Immediate Action Committee in each jurisdiction.\nThe various Boards and their committees can be found in Appendix 1 of Ahpra annual report.",

There are some differences between jurisdictions as to the extent to which the National Law\nhas been adopted. This affects what Ahpra or a Board can do in specific jurisdictions.\nFor example, the jurisdictions of NSW and Queensland have declared that they are no t participating in the\nhealth, performance and conduct process provided by Part 8, Divisions 2–12 of the National Law. By making\nthis declaration and amending the National Law, each of those jurisdictions is known as a 'co-regulatory\njurisdiction':\n- NSW decided not to adopt Part 8 of the National Law in its entirety. Rather, the relevant health\nprofessionals councils work with the Health Professional Councils Authority and the Health Care\nComplaints Commission to manage concerns about conduct, health and performance  of\npractitioners.\n- Queensland decided to vary the operation of Part 8 of the National Law, specifically in respect of\nmatters that relate to professional misconduct. These matters must be referred to the Office of the\nHealth Ombudsman (OHO) who has power to retain such matters.",

Health Ministers from\neach state and territory and the Commonwealth are members of the Ministerial Council.  Under section 11 of\nthe National Law, the Ministerial Council may issue Ahpra and National Boards with policy directions.\nCurrently, there are two policy directions:\n- Policy Direction 2019-01, which deals with the paramountcy of public protection when administering\nthe National Scheme; and\n- Policy Direction 2019-02, which deals with requirements to consult with patient safety bodies and\nhealth care consumer bodies on every new and revised registration standard, code and guidelines.\nRelevance of Policy Directions to tribunal proceedings under the National Law\nThe question of whether a responsible tribunal is bound by the Policy Direction has been considered in\nvarious recent tribunal decisions, predominantly in the context of decisions involving a review of a Board\ndecision.  A responsible tribunal recently held that it was not bound to follow the Policy Direction (being a\ndirection given by the Ministerial Council to a Board) in the absence of a clear statement in the National Law\nthat it should be bound.1\nHowever, any COAG Policy Directions will apply to all decisions made by Ahpra and the Boards (outside of a\ntribunal proceeding).  The Policy Directions may also assist a responsible tribunal in interpreting relevant\nportions of the National Law, or placing certain aspects of the National Law in context.",

Notifications\n2.1 Introduction\nPart 8 of the National Law sets out the processes by which notifications may be made about a registered\nhealth practitioner. A 'notification' is an expression of concern about a health practitioner or a notification of\nprescribed circumstances to Ahpra or a Board by a health practitioner or employer.  A person who makes a\nnotification is called a 'notifier'.\nNotifications may be made to Ahpra:\n- verbally, including by telephone; or\n- in writing, including by email or other electronic means.\nIf a notification is made verbally, Ahpra must make a record of the notification.\nThe notification process is designed to be accessible, informative, responsive and independent. Ahpra wi ll\nprovide notifiers assistance in making a notification – for example, if access to an interpreter or translator is\nrequired, arrangements will be made through the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS National). Ahpra\nis also conscious of the impact that being involved in a notification process can have on notifiers,\npractitioners and other people. Ahpra and other bodies provide support throughout the notifications process .\nA person who, in good faith, makes a notification or gives information in the course of an investigation by the\nBoard or Ahpra, is not liable civilly, criminally or under an administrative process for giving the information. 2\nGood faith is not defined in the National Law so it adopts its ordinary meaning of 'well -intentioned or without\nmalice'.3\n2.2 Information and privacy\nKEY POINTS\n- Ahpra (rather than the Boards) holds all information under the National Law.\n- Information obtained in the course of exercising functions under the National Law is kept confidential\n(except where disclosure of the information is permitted by law).\n- While notifications may be made confidentially or anonymously, there can be limitations in progressing\ninvestigations of anonymous notifications.\n- Further details about Ahpra's use of information is contained in its Privacy Policy.\nProtected information\nInformation that comes to a person's knowledge in the course of exercising functions under the National Law\nis known as 'protected information'. This includes details of notifications or notifiers.\nUnder section 216 of the National Law, protected information must be kept confidential and not be disclosed\nto another person. However, this is subject to some exceptions including:\n- if the information is disclosed in the exercise of a function under the National Law (for example,\ninformation provided to Ahpra may be shared with other Ahpra employees and provided to a relevant\nBoard);\n- if the information is disclosed to a co-regulatory authority (such as in Queensland or NSW – see1.3);\n- if the disclosure is otherwise required or permitted by law; or\n- if the information is already in the public domain (such as if it relates to tribunal proceedings which\nare or were open to the public).\nSections 217 to 221 of the National Law provide several further exceptions from the general requirement to\nkeep protected information confidential, including allowing disclosure to certain Commonwealth and state\nentities, if certain preconditions are met.",

    "text": "It is common for practitioners, in connection with regulatory action taken by the relevant Board under the\nNational Law, to be required to produce copies of relevant clinical records.  For example. this may be\nrequired in response to a request issued under Schedule 5 of the National Law (for more information, see\n5.2) or in order to comply with a condition on a practitioner's registration.  APP 6.2(b) creates an exception to\nAPP 6 where the ‘use or disclosure of the information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law\nor a court/tribunal order’, which is defined in section 6 of the Privacy Act to include an Act of the\nCommonwealth or a State or Territory.\nA recent decision of a responsible tribunal has confirmed that, even in circumstances where the relevant\npatients have not consented to the disclosure, APP 6 will not operate to prevent a practitioner complying with\na condition on their registration requiring them to submit to an audit of their clinical records.  The Tribunal\nnoted that the monitoring of conditions is a function of the relevant Board and so the conduct of any audit\nand supervision can be seen to be required or authorised by the National Law.4\nLimitations on confidentiality in the notifications process\nWhile Ahpra will assess notifications which have been made anonymously or confidentially, there are\nlimitations in progressing investigations of anonymous notifications (as further information cannot be\nobtained from the notifier).\nAhpra will request the notifier's consent to disclosing their identifying details (such as name and sometimes\ndate of birth) to the practitioner who is the subject of the notification. Even where the identity of a notifier is\nnot provided to the practitioner, it may be possible for the practitioner to identify the notifier based on the\ninformation that they are provided. Practitioners have professional obligations to cooperate with Board\ninvestigations. They may be subject to further disciplinary action if they try to interfere with this process in\nany way, including by, for example, contacting or attempting to contact a notifier or witness.\nThe practitioner must be provided with enough information about the conduct, health or performance\nconcerns raised in the notification so as to enable them to respond. In many cases, it will not be possible to\nprogress a matter without the notifier being a witness in any resulting panel, section 178 or tribunal\nproceedings. Ahpra therefore cannot guarantee anonymity or complete confidentiality.",

This is known as a mandatory notification.\nA mandatory notification must be made as soon as practicable after a practitioner forms a reasonable\nbelief that:\n- another registered health practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes notifiable conduct ; or\n- a student has an impairment that, in the course of the student undertaking clinical training, may place\nthe public at risk of harm.5\nMandatory notifications must also be made by employers, if the employer reasonably believes that its\nemployee health practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes notifiable conduct. 6\n'Notifiable conduct' occurs when a practitioner has:\n- practised while intoxicated by alcohol or drugs;\n- engaged in sexual misconduct in connection with the practice of their profession;\n- placed the public at risk of substantial harm in their practice of the profession because they have an\nimpairment; or\n- placed the public at risk of harm because they have practised the profession in a way that constitutes\na significant departure from accepted professional standards. 7\n‘Treating practitioners’\nSection 141 does not apply when the health practitioner who can form a reasonable belief of ‘notifiable\nconduct’, forms the reasonable belief in the course of providing a health service to a health practitioner (ie –\nthey are a ‘treating practitioner’).8\nA treating practitioner’s obligation to mandatorily notify Ahpra is different.  It operates if, in the course of\nproviding a health service to a registered health practitioner, the treating practitioner:\n- forms a reasonable belief that the health practitioner has engaged, is engaging, or is at risk of\nengaging, in sexual misconduct in connection with the practice of the practitioner’s profession; 9 or\n- forms a reasonable belief that the health practitioner is placing the public at substantial risk of  harm\nby practising the profession—\no while the practitioner has an impairment; or",

These are:\n- the nature, extent and severity of the impairment;\n- the extent to which the second health practitioner or student is taking, or is willing to take, steps to\nmanage the impairment;\n- the extent to which the impairment can be managed with appropriate treatment;\n- any other matter the treating practitioner considers is relevant to the risk of harm the impairment\nposes to the public.11\nNB: Practitioners in Western Australia are not required to make a mandatory notification about another\npractitioner if their reasonable belief (about misconduct or impairment) is formed while providing health\nservices to that person.12\nFurther information about mandatory notifications\nIf a practitioner fails to make a mandatory notification when they have formed a reasonable belief that\nnotifiable conduct has occurred, this may constitute behaviour for which regulatory action may be taken. 13\nMandatory notifications must be made about any other registered health practitioner, regardless of whether\nthey are registered in the same, or different, profession as the practitioner who becomes aware of the\nconduct.\nEach National Board publishes guidelines regarding mandatory notifications, which are available online.\nThe guidelines contain detailed information about the mandatory notifications scheme, including the concept\nof 'reasonable belief' in this context. The guidelines also contain 'decision guides' to assist practitioners or\nemployers who might be uncertain whether a mandatory notification should be made.\nThere are some exceptions to the requirement for practitioners to make a mandatory notification, including\nwhere the practitioner reasonably believes that Ahpra is already aware of the notifiable conduct;  14 or whether\nthe registered health practitioner has become aware of the conduct while working in a specified role or\ncapacity.15\nVoluntary notifications\nVoluntary notifications may be made by any entity or person, including patients and members of the public.\nUnder section 144 of the National Law, a voluntary notification about a registered health practitioner may be\nmade to Ahpra on any of the following grounds:\n- that the practitioner’s professional conduct is, or may be, of a lesser standard than that which might\nreasonably be expected of them by the public or their professional peers;\n- that the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised by, the practitioner in the practice\nof their health profession is, or may be, below the standard reasonably expected;\n- that the practitioner is not, or may not be, a suitable person to hold registration in the health\nprofession, including, for example, that the practitioner is not a fit and proper person to be registered\nin the profession;\n- that the practitioner has, or may have, an impairment;\n- that the practitioner has, or may have, contravened the National Law;\n- that the practitioner has, or may have, contravened a condition of the practitioner’s registration or an\nundertaking given by the practitioner to a National Board; or",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 14\nBehaviour outside the jurisdiction\nA health practitioner can be subject to regulatory action in one state or territory for conduct occurring in\nanother. Under section 8, the National Law operates in respect of acts, transactions and matters done,\nentered into or occurring outside, as well as in, the territorial limits of the relevant jurisdiction.\nIf Ahpra receives a notification concerning behaviour occurring in a co-regulatory jurisdiction, it will not deal\nwith the notification and will refer the notification to the appropriate co-regulatory authority.17\nIf Ahpra receives a notification concerning behaviour occurring in more than one jurisdiction, and one of the\njurisdictions is a co-regulatory jurisdiction, it will:\n- if the relevant practitioner's principal place of practice is in the co-regulatory jurisdiction, refer the\nnotification to the co-regulatory jurisdiction; or\n- otherwise, deal with the notification in the usual way (by referring it to the relevant Board). 18\nBehaviour while unregistered\nPractitioners may be subject to regulatory action for behaviour occurring while unregistered. A National\nBoard is required to refer a matter about a 'registered health practitioner' to a responsible tribunal if it\nreasonably believes that:\n- the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes professional misconduct; or\n- the practitioner's registration was improperly obtained because the practitioner or someone else\ngave the Board information or a document that was false or misleading in a material particular.\nAlthough jurisdiction is conferred on the responsible tribunal for matters about registered health\npractitioners, the conduct the subject of the referral may have occurred at a time when the practitioner was\nunregistered.\nExample\nIn Dental Board of Australia v Dr Ho,19 the matter before the responsible tribunal involved conduct\noccurring while Dr Ho was unregistered, although he had been registered previously and was\nregistered at the time of the referral. The fact that the alleged conduct occurred while Dr Ho was\nunregistered was not a bar to the Tribunal determining the matter.\nAnother example may be a practitioner who is found to have, at a time when they were not registered,\nengaged in historical conduct the subject of a criminal investigation or prosecution.  If the practitioner is\nregistered when the conduct is brought to the attention of the Board, the practitioner may be subject to\nimmediate action and disciplinary action about that conduct.\nPersonal and professional conduct\nNotifications may be made, and subsequent regulatory action taken by a Board, about a registered\npractitioner’s personal conduct, in some circumstances.\n'Professional conduct' refers to conduct that is connected to the practitioner's practice of the profession\n(such as their conduct with a patient, at work or in a relevant academic setting). On the other hand, 'personal\nconduct' as that term is used in this guide, relates to conduct occurring in a setting unrelated to the\npractitioner's practice of the profession.\nRegulatory action may be taken about either professional or personal conduct. For example, subparagraph\n(c) of the definition of professional misconduct (discussed further at 9.5) contained within section 5 of the\nNational Law, refers to:\n'conduct … whether occurring in connection with the practice of the health practitioner's\nprofession or not, that is inconsistent with the practitioner being a fit and proper person to hold\nregistration in the profession' (emphasis added).\nThese concepts are discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 17\n3. Immediate action\n3.1 Introduction\nKEY POINTS\n- The Board’s immediate action powers enable it to restrict or preclude a practitioner’s practice of their profession as\nan interim step while it investigates a practitioner.\n- The Board only uses these interim powers with a small number of practitioners and after it provides a practitioner\nwith an opportunity to explain why the action should not be taken.\n- Examples of behaviour about which immediate action may be taken include:\n– alleged serious criminal conduct (including where charges have been laid but before any conviction);\n– conduct unconnected to practice that may diminish the public's confidence in the profession;\n– serious performance issues;\n– sexual misconduct;\n– substance abuse;\n– breaches of conditions on registration.\n- Examples of other circumstances in which immediate action might be taken include where:\n– a practitioner has, or may have, an impairment that could pose a serious risk to the public;\n– a practitioner's registration was improperly obtained because the practitioner or someone else gave the relevant\nBoard information or a document that was false or misleading in a material particular; and\n– a practitioner's registration has been cancelled or suspended in a non-participating jurisdiction\n(whether within Australia or elsewhere).\nImmediate action is interim action that a Board can take to restrict or suspend a practitioner's ability to\npractise. A Board will do so if it reasonably believes that interim regulatory action is necessary to protect the\npublic from a serious risk or is otherwise in the public interest. Immediate action may be taken at any time,\nalthough it is most often taken very soon after a notification about a practitioner has been received. A Board\nwill move quickly if necessary to address risk posed by a practitioner or if the public interest requires it.\nImmediate action is defined to mean:\n- the suspension of, or imposition of a condition on, the health practitioner's registration;\n- accepting an undertaking from the health practitioner;\n- accepting the surrender of the health practitioner’s registration;\n- if immediate action has previously been taken by suspending a health practitioner's registration,\nthe revocation of the suspension and the imposition of a condition on the registration; and\n- if immediate action has previously taken by imposing a condition on a health practitioner's\nregistration, the suspension of the registration instead of the condition.\nImmediate action can only be taken in circumstances where there also has been, or will be, some other\nfurther action taken in respect of a practitioner (such as an investigation or a health or performance\nassessment). The nature and seriousness of the practitioner's conduct or performance deficiencies, or\nimpairment/potential impairment, are decisive factors in determining whether immediate action is necessary,\nand the form it will take. Community expectations also bear upon whether the Board reasonably believes that\nit would be in the public interest to take immediate action.\nBecause of the interim nature of immediate action decisions, often the allegations about the practitioner's\nconduct or performance have not yet been fully investigated. Quite often, no proven conduct or sworn\nevidence is available when the immediate action is considered. A Board will assess the material before it\nwhen considering whether immediate action is required. If it forms a reasonable belief, on the information\nbefore it, that the requirements for immediate action are met (discussed at 3.2), a Board will take that action.",

For example, posting offensive or demeaning comments on social\nmedia that may, in some circumstances, undermine the public's confidence in the\nprofession.",

Often the fact of, and serious\nnature of, allegations about a practitioner, where supported by witness statements or othe r documentary\nmaterial (even where the witness has not been cross-examined about their statement), will be sufficient to\nsupport a reasonable belief as to the existence of a serious risk. 34\nThe Board will consider the specific nature of the serious risk. This includes an assessment of who may be at\nrisk (that is, the risk may be to the public in general, or to a specific population, such as female patients, or\npatients with a particular medical condition). For example, responsible tribunals have previously confirmed\nthat the following kinds of risks are 'serious' and appropriate grounds for taking immediate action:\n- the risk to the public of unnecessary surgery, incorrect or inadequate treatment or failure to provide\nadequate rehabilitation or access to services as a result of a lack of up-to-date medical knowledge;\n- the risk to the public posed by a practitioner alleged to have engaged in sexual misconduct;\n- the risk posed to paediatric patients with Perthes disease as a result of a practitioner's unsatisfactory\nclinical decision-making about the use of platelet rich plasma;\n- the risk posed to people who may purchase drugs illegally manufactured with dextromethorpan as\nan ingredient; and\n-  the risk posed to the public by a practitioner who published material on social media about vaccines,\nchemotherapy, and vitamin C and COVID-19, that had no proper clinical basis and was contrary to\naccepted medical practice or that was otherwise untrue or misleading.\nNecessity\nHaving formed a reasonable belief that a practitioner poses a 'serious risk' to people (as set out above),\na Board must also form a reasonable belief that the proposed immediate action is necessary to protect\npublic health and safety. The concept of what is 'necessary' has been stated to be 'a flexible one and one that\nvaries according to the nature of the case.'35 In the context of immediate action, it is best understood as\nbeing the same as 'required'.\nThe nature and seriousness of the practitioner's conduct or performance deficiencies,\nor impairment/potential impairment, are decisive factors in determining whether immediate action is\nnecessary, and the form it will take. The form of immediate action will reflect the minimum regulatory\nresponse the Board considers necessary to address the identified serious risks to the public.\nSection 156(1)(c): Registration improperly obtained\nUnder section 156(1)(c), a Board may take immediate action about a registered practitioner if that\npractitioner's registration was improperly obtained because the practitioner, or someone else, gave the\nNational Board information or a document that was false or misleading in a material particular.  For example,\nwhere a practitioner creates and relies upon a false document in seeking to have their overseas qualifications\nverified.\nSection 156(1)(d): Suspended under the law of a non-participating jurisdiction\nUnder section 156(1)(d), immediate action may be taken by a Board in respect of practitioner who has been\nsuspended under the law of another, non-participating jurisdiction. This may occur in circumstances where a\npractitioner has been suspended before a final hearing has taken place. 36",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 20\nSection 156(1)(e): Otherwise in the public interest\nThe 'public interest' ground contained in section 156(1)(e) was introduced into the National Law b y the\nHealth Practitioner Regulation National Law and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2017 (Qld) (Amendment\nAct) and commenced operation on 1 March 2018.\nThe public interest ground allows the Boards to consider and take immediate action in circumstances where\nthe Board may not have formed a view that the practitioner poses a serious risk to people ; but it is otherwise\nin the public interest to do so.\nThe National Law provides one example of when the public interest ground might be engaged:\nExample of when action may be taken in the public interest:\nA registered health practitioner is charged with a serious criminal offence, unrelated to the\npractitioner's practice, for which immediate action is required to be taken to maintain public\nconfidence in the provision of services by health practitioners.\nThe Supreme Court of Victoria has previously considered the public interest ground.  The Court held that the\nexample in the National Law is not exhaustive. 37 The Court also held that the word 'otherwise' in the sub-\nsection indicates that this ground 'provides an additional and alternative source of power that is available'\nwhere none of the other grounds are met. It later commented that:\n… in other cases, it may be necessary to take action to reassure the public that the regulatory system is\nsafe and adequate to protect the public and the reputation of the profession as a whole … As a\nconsequence, the Board may conclude, in those circumstances, that it is in the public interest to take\nimmediate action in order to address the question of public confidence. The relevant public confidence\nto which the example is directed, is confidence in the profession of services by health professionals.38\nThe Second Reading Speech of the Amendment Act demonstrates this:\nIt is important to ensure that immediate action can be taken against health practitioners where public\ninterest considerations require it. An example of where the public interest test may be used to take\nimmediate action is if a serious criminal charges laid but the charges may not be directly related to the\nperson’s conduct as a health practitioner. In cases like these it can be difficult to show that the threshold\nof ‘serious risk to persons’ in the National Law is reached. However, it may be appropriate to impose\nconditions on the person’s registration for public protection and confidence in the health profession.\nAccordingly, the public interest ground has been engaged, and relied upon in circumstances other than\nserious criminal offending.\nExample of when action may be taken in the public interest – social media posting:\nThe social media posts of a registered health practitioner arguably denigrate, demean and slur members\nof their profession who engage in legal and ethical medical treatment and/or vuln erable members of the\ncommunity, and if immediate action were not taken, it would significantly undermine public confidence\nin the medical profession and the willingness of (some) members of the public to seek appropriate\ntreatment.\nWhen considering whether or not to take immediate action under section 156(1)(e), Boards will consider and\nbalance matters such as:\n- the impact of the practitioner's conduct on the public's confidence in the relevant profession,\nspecifically, the confidence in the provision of services by medical practitioners (which will\nnecessarily impact the willingness or not of members of the public to access medical treatment) ;\n- the maintenance of professional standards; and\n- the competing public interests that weigh against the taking of immediate action – for example:\no the public interest in allowing an otherwise competent practitioner to continue to provide\nhealth services in an area of need; and\no the public interest in ensuring the regulatory system responds proportionately and fairly\nwhen allegations are made.",

This may be the case even if the alleged conduct occurred outside a practitioner's practice of the\nprofession. The alleged conduct does not have to satisfy the grounds contained in section 156(1)(a) to (d).  It\nis not limited to conduct that is the subject of a criminal investigation or charges. In many, if not most, cases,\nthe only logical form of immediate action under the public interest ground is suspension. This is because, in\nmost cases, the potential risk to the reputation of (and the public's confidence in) the relevant profession can\nonly be addressed by ensuring that the relevant practitioner is not permitted to practise the profession during\nthe period of immediate action.\nEXAMPLE 1\nPractitioner charged with serious criminal offences – immediate action taken under section\n156(1)(e)\nFACTS DECISION\nA practitioner (who was registered in\nmultiple professions) was arrested\nand charged with serious forced\nlabour offences.\nEach of the relevant Boards took immediate action by imposing conditions\non the practitioner's registration. The decision was upheld by the\nresponsible tribunal on review. The Tribunal considered 'that the fact of\ncharges having been laid against [the practitioner] coupled with the serious\nnature of those charges supported by the (albeit untested) allegations in\nand of itself provide[d] a sufficient factual basis to form a reasonable belief\nthat it [was] in the public interest for immediate action to be taken'.",

Possible impairments might also be identified when monitoring compliance with\nrestrictions or during an investigation into other issues.\n4.3 Decision to require health assessment\nMany health practitioners have ongoing health conditions that are well-managed and do not affect their ability\nto practise safely. However, a Board may require the practitioner to undergo a health assessment if it is\nconcerned that the practitioner might have an impairment that could adversely affect the practitioner’s ability\nto practise.

Alternatively, a practitioner with a similar illness, who lacks\ninsight and/or refuses to comply with treatment recommendations, may pose a risk and a health assessment\nmay be appropriate.\n4.4 Health assessment process\nBefore a health assessment\nAhpra will appoint an assessor who has been approved by the relevant Board to carry out a health\nassessment.54 The assessor will be a medical practitioner or psychologist who is:\n- not a member of the Board;55 and\n- experienced, appropriately qualified and independent.\nSo as to ensure independence, it is important that there is no conflict of interest between the practitioner and\nthe person carrying out the assessment. The practitioner and the assessor will be asked to confirm that they\nhave no financial, personal or professional relationship before the assessment.\nThe Board will provide the practitioner with written notice, stating, among other things:\n- the nature of the assessment to be carried out; and\n- that if the practitioner does not undergo the assessment, the Board may take other regulatory action\n(for example, immediate action, relevant action, referral to a panel or the responsible tribunal). 56\nBefore and during a health assessment, the assessor may require the practitioner to undergo other testing,\nfor example neuropsychological testing, drug or alcohol testing or radiological imagi ng.\nDuring a health assessment\nThe health assessment will generally involve a consultation or series of consultations, arranged by Ahpra,\nbetween the practitioner and the appointed assessor. The assessor may also wish to review any relevant\nmedical records, and/or require the practitioner to undergo further testing.\n4.5 Performance assessments\nA Board may require a practitioner to undergo a performance assessment if the Board reasonably believes,\nbecause of a notification or for any other reason, that the way the practitioner practises the profession is, or\nmay be, unsatisfactory.57 Other than when considering notifications, a Board might develop a reasonable\nbelief when monitoring compliance with restrictions or during an investigation into other issues.\nA performance assessment is defined in the National Law as:\nan assessment of the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised by, a  registered\nhealth practitioner in the practice of the health profession in which the practitioner is registered. 58\nThe meaning of 'unsatisfactory professional performance' is discussed at 9.4.\nExamples of practices that may result in a Board directing a practitioner to undergo a performance\nassessment include concerns about:\n- excessive and/or inappropriate prescribing practices;\n- assessment and diagnostic skills;\n- procedures carried out to a poor standard;\n- decisions relating to treatment that are not clinically justified or evidence-based; or\n- inadequate record-keeping.",

Procedural fairness is a legal principle which\nrequires that fair and proper procedures are followed when making a decision that may affect a person's\nrights or interests.\nThe National Law is not prescriptive about what is required to ensure that a practitioner is afforded\nprocedural fairness in the course of an investigation. Common law principles will apply.87 What this means in\npractice is that the process an investigator adopts is flexible and may vary depending on the nature of the\ninvestigation.\nIn most cases, it will be appropriate for an investigator to provide a practitioner with material that is relevant\nto the allegations being investigated.\nWhere evidence is obtained during the course of an investigation that will have the effect of expanding the\nscope of the issues which are the subject of the investigation, procedural fairness may require the\npractitioner to be given an additional opportunity to respond to any new issues.\nCircumstances in which an investigation may be placed on hold\nAn investigation may be placed on hold if it is unable to be progressed for a period of time (but has not yet\nconcluded).\nThis may occur, for example, when there is a criminal investigation or proceeding underway which relates to\nthe practitioner's conduct that is being investigated. Often, the Board's investigation will be placed on hold\nuntil the conclusion of the criminal investigation or prosecution. It is generally considered appropriate for\ncriminal proceedings to take place before a disciplinary proceeding for several reasons (such as to minimise\nthe chance of witnesses having to give evidence in two separate proceedings, though this still may be\nrequired). As discussed at 9.7, even if a criminal proceeding ends in acquittal, the relevant conduct may still\nbe found proven for the purposes of a disciplinary proceeding.\nA Board will notify a practitioner if it decides to place an investigation on hold.",

For example, a practitioner might\nundertake to practise between the hours of 9.00am and 5.00pm only.\nCautions and conditions are discussed further at 10.2.\nThe form of relevant action will reflect the necessary regulatory response that a Board considers to be\nrequired to respond to the risk posed by a practitioner. The nature and seriousness of findings about a\npractitioner are decisive factors in determining whether relevant action is necessary, and the form it will take.\nExamples of the conditions that a Board may impose on a practitioner's registration include conditions\nrequiring a practitioner:\n- to complete specified further education or training within a specified period;\n- to undertake a specified period of supervised practice;\n- to do, or refrain from doing, something in connection with the practitioner's practice;\n- to manage the practitioner's practice in a specified way;\n- to report to a specified person about the practitioner's practice; or\n- not to employ, engage or recommend a specified person, or class of people.\nIf a Board decides to take relevant action by imposing a condition on a practitioner's registration, it will also\nimpose a review period for the condition.97\nWhen a condition is reviewed, the Board will decide whether to:\n- remove the condition;\n- amend the condition; or\n- maintain the condition.\nSection 125 of the National Law additionally sets out the process by which conditions or an undertaking may\nbe changed or removed (on application by a practitioner). Such an application must not be made during the\nreview period for a condition or undertaking, unless the practitioner reasonably believes that there has been\na material change in their circumstances.\nSections 125 and 126 of the National Law provide for changing conditions on the Board’s initiative and the\nremoval of conditions or undertakings.\n6.3 Procedure and show cause process\nIf a Board proposes to take relevant action about a registered health practitioner, the Board will:\n- provide the practitioner with written notice of the proposed relevant action; and\n- invite the practitioner to make a written or verbal submission to the Board about the proposed\nrelevant action.98",

A copy of that\ndocument(s) will also be served on the practitioner or their representative. The precise form and title of the\ndocument(s) that initiate the tribunal process differs between the various tribunals –  each responsible tribunal\nwill have its own requirements.\nThe documents starting the disciplinary proceeding will include a document setting out the allegations made\nabout the practitioner. The purpose of this document is to put the practitioner on notice of what the Board\nsays occurred and, in the Board's view, how that conduct ought to be characterised –  that is, the appropriate\nfindings that the Board will ask the responsible tribunal to make (discussed further in Chapter 9). Again,\neach jurisdiction has its own procedural requirements, however, a practitioner will be given an opportunity to\nrespond to this document.\nParties to a disciplinary proceeding started before a responsible tribunal\nIdentity of the parties\nThe parties to a proceeding started by the Board are:\n- the Board that referred the matter; and\n- the practitioner.144\nIn most jurisdictions, tribunal documents, including orders and decisions, will refer to the Board as the\nApplicant/Complainant, and to the practitioner as the Respondent.\nLegal representation\nParties in disciplinary proceedings before a responsible tribunal may be legally represented, though in some\nresponsible tribunals the legal representative may need to seek leave to appear.\nThe Board will usually be represented by a firm of solicitors. If a practitioner’s professional indemnity insurer\nhas agreed to cover the practitioner’s legal costs and expenses, the insurer may engage lawyers to represent\nthe practitioner.

Tribunals are not bound by the same strict rules of\nevidence as courts.\nThe proceedings are generally open to members of the public except where otherwise ordered (in some\njurisdictions, interlocutory hearings are not open to the public). A tribunal's final decision will usually be\npublished on the tribunal's website and/or the Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII) website.\nWitness confidentiality\nEfforts will be made by the Boards to protect the confidentiality of witnesses and notifiers.  Where necessary,\na Board will request:\n- an order that the responsible tribunal close the tribunal's file, meaning that it can only be viewed by\nthe parties to a proceeding and their representatives, without leave of the tribunal;\n- an order protecting the privacy of its witnesses. For example, it may request the responsible tribunal\nmake:\no A suppression or non-publication order. This order may be made by the responsible\ntribunal to restrict or prevent the publication of, for example, any information that might\nenable the identification of a witness or their family members (this would include thei r name,\nand potentially other information such as where the alleged conduct occurred).\no A pseudonym order. This order is generally made prior to the commencement of a\nproceeding, requiring that a person/people be named by way of pseudonym in court\ndocuments yet to be produced and filed. Where a pseudonym order has been made, this will\nnot 'prohibit or restrict the publication or other disclosure of information in connection with a\nproceeding'. Pseudonym orders can also be made, following the commencement of a\nproceeding.\nThe powers of a responsible tribunal to make orders closing a file, suppression orders, non- publication\norders or pseudonym orders varies between the states and territories. It is not usual for a responsible tribunal\nto make a suppression order restricting publication of the practitioner's identity. Publication of the\npractitioner's identity is, in most cases, essential for the purposes of open justice and is one of the means by\nwhich the National Law achieves its aim of protecting the public.\nEfficiency of proceedings\nBoards seek to have proceedings progress through to completion as efficiently as possible.  The purpose of\nthis is to:\n- limit the emotional, financial and professional impact on the affected practitioner;\n- limit the impact on the notifier, witnesses and victims who may have been significantly affected by\nthe conduct and want proceedings to be finalised as quickly as possible to allow them to move on.\nThis is particularly so for victims required to give evidence, where the impact of preparing for final\nhearing (and any subsequent delay) can be traumatic; and\n- limit the financial cost of the proceeding.",

That said,\nattending directions hearings incurs time and expense for the parties, notifiers, victims and the responsible\ntribunal. Accordingly, Ahpra strives to avoid multiple directions hearings and it is common for either:\n- the parties to reach agreement on what any procedural orders should look like, particularly if the\nBoard and the practitioner are legally represented. If agreement can be reached, the parties will put\nthese orders into a document, and sign it (‘consent orders’). In many instances, if the tribunal agrees\nwith the orders, the directions hearing will be 'vacated' (cancelled) and the requested orders will be\nmade 'by consent'; or\n- the responsible tribunal to list an administrative hearing date (by which time the parties are to report\nto the tribunal by electronic communication) (administrative mention). This helps discussions\nbetween the parties about what appropriate consent orders may look like, and provides a date by\nwhich time ‘consent orders’ are to be filed with the responsible tribunal.\nCompulsory conference/mediation\nWhat is a compulsory conference?\nIt is common practice for tribunals to require the parties to attend a ‘compulsory conference’, ‘preliminary\nconference’ or ‘mediation’ (the name of this hearing varies between the various responsible tribunals – in this\nguide, the term 'compulsory conference' is used). Its purpose is to aid discussions between the parties to:\n- narrow the issues in dispute; and\n- explore whether a resolution can be reached.\nA compulsory conference is a confidential meeting attended by the parties and presided over by a tribunal\nmember. It provides the parties with the opportunity to discuss the allegations, factual matters that are\nagreed or in dispute, and the outcome each party considers appropriate. The parties are not permitted to\ndisclose what was said in a compulsory conference to third parties.\nA compulsory conference is conducted on a ‘without prejudice’ basis. This means that anything said in the\ncompulsory conference (for example – any concessions made to see if a resolution can be reached) may not\nbe used by either party in the course of the proceeding.\nWhen presiding over a compulsory conference, the role of the tribunal member is not to make a decision\nabout the case, but to help discussion between the parties and make any consequential orders. Because of\nthe confidential and ‘without prejudice’ nature of a compulsory conference, the tribunal member who\npresides over it, will not usually preside over any final hearing.\nWhat happens at a compulsory conference?\nAt the compulsory conference, the parties will see if they can reach agreement on the facts, findings\n(see Chapter 9) and determinations/disciplinary sanction/penalty (see Chapter 10 –  for the remainder of this\nchapter, the term determination will be used).\nIf an agreement on the facts can be reached, the parties will prepare an Agreed statement of facts and sign\nit. In almost all cases, it will be possible for the parties to reach agreement on at least some of the alleged\nfacts – for example, the fact that a particular person was the practitioner's patient; or that specific conduct did\nin fact, take place.\nIf the parties can agree on the facts, then they may also be in a position to agree on the findings (that is,\nthe appropriate characterisation of the conduct as professional misconduct, unprofessional conduct or\nunsatisfactory professional performance) and the determinations to be imposed by the responsible tribunal.  If\nthe parties are able to reach agreement on these matters, the agreement will be recorded in the\nagreed statement of facts (the title of the agreed statement of facts document will generally be changed\nto reflect this).",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 48\nA compulsory conference in a disciplinary proceeding before a responsible tribunal is not comparable to a\nmediation in a civil proceeding. In a civil proceeding, the party that started the proceeding is generally\nseeking financial compensation. This requires the parties to be commercial when negotiating an outcome. A\ndisciplinary proceeding is not a civil proceeding. The purpose of the proceeding is not financial, it is\nprotective (see 10.2). A Board must act in accordance with its statutory objectives and functions, and comply\nwith its model litigant policy.\nA Board will only have started a disciplinary proceeding before a responsible tribunal because, on the\ninformation before it, it formed a reasonable belief that:\n- the practitioner had engaged in specific conduct; and\n- that conduct constitutes professional misconduct.\nAs a consequence of this a Board will:\n- only make concessions about factual matters where it is necessary or appropriate in light of the\navailable evidence;\n- only agree to a characterisation of the conduct that properly reflects the evidence/gravity of the\nconduct (see Chapter 9); and\n- only agree to determinations that properly reflect the variety of considerations to which it (and the\nresponsible tribunal) must pay regard (see Chapter 10).\nWhat happens after a compulsory conference?\nIf a complete resolution of the matter is reached between the parties, each jurisdiction will finalise the matter\naccording to its own procedures and requirements. In some jurisdictions, the responsible tribunal may make\norders on the day on the basis of the parties' agreed statement of facts. In other jurisdictions, the responsible\ntribunal may require a short final hearing.\nIf the responsible tribunal requires a final hearing, the parties will be required to make submissions about the\nagreed resolution, and why the responsible tribunal should make orders consistent with that agreement.  A\nresponsible tribunal is unlikely to depart from an agreement without a clear or exceptional reason.\nIt is common for the Board and the practitioner to agree on the facts, but not agree on the findings and\ndeterminations. In this circumstance, the parties will have a final hearing before the responsible tribunal\nabout:\n- how the conduct should be characterised; and\n- what determinations should be made.\nIf the matter cannot be resolved, the tribunal member will make orders setting the matter down for a\ncontested final hearing on all issues (facts, findings and determinations). This may be a staged process\n(that is, a contested hearing on the facts, and a separate hearing on the findings and determinations).\nIn all cases, an agreed outcome (in whole or in part) will generally make the final hearing quicker, mor e\nefficient and less costly for all parties.\nOther matters\nIssuing a summons\nA responsible tribunal has the power to summons a person to produce documents or attend to provide\nevidence in a proceeding. Failure to comply with a summons is an offence and may result in a penalty\n(including a period of imprisonment).\nIssuing a summons may be necessary when the Board or the practitioner:\n- want to rely on evidence or documents held by a third party; and\n- must formally require that third party to attend to give evidence and/or produce the documents to the\nresponsible tribunal.\nExchange of material\nThe exchange of material allows:\n- the practitioner to review the evidence that will be relied upon by the Board, and permits them to\nunderstand the case against them, and the evidence that will be relied upon by the Board;\n- the Board to understand the position the practitioner will take.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 49\nThis can be a very time-consuming and expensive step for a party to take. Therefore, each jurisdiction has its\nown requirements for when this step takes place, and in what circumstances. However, if the matter is to\nproceed to a contested hearing, it is a step that the parties will likely be required to take. Generally:\n- the Board will be required to file and serve the material upon which it proposes to rely first;\n- the practitioner will be provided with the opportunity consider it, and file and serve:\no the material upon which they will rely; or\no an outline document which sets out the practitioner’s response to the documents (each\nresponsible tribunal will have its own requirements); and\n- the Board will generally be given the opportunity to review any material filed by the practitioner, and\nfile any 'material in reply' (if necessary).\nThe reference to 'material' means any substantive evidentiary documents. These may include documents\ncollected in the course of the investigation, clinical records, witness statements or independent expert\nopinions either party may rely upon.\nThis process:\n- ensures that, before the hearing, to some extent, each party is on notice of the evidence that the\nother party will rely on at the hearing (and/or of the arguments that will be made); and\n- enables the parties to narrow the issues in dispute.\n8.4 Final hearing\nConstitution of tribunal\nA final hearing is presided over by a panel of tribunal members. The tribunal panel is generally constituted by\na presiding member with legal qualifications, as well as at least one member who is a health professional in\nthe same profession as the relevant practitioner (called professional members). Sometimes members of the\ncommunity also sit on the tribunal panel. The specific make-up of each tribunal panel will differ between\nresponsible tribunals.\nThe purpose of having a professional member sit on the tribunal panel is partially to ensure that a\npractitioner's conduct is being assessed with the assistance and perspective of one of their professional\npeers. It also enables the responsible tribunal to hear a matter without the need for formal evidence about\nknowledge, matters or concepts that are generally accepted or known within a certain profession.\nStandard and burden of proof\nThe burden of proof rests with the Board, meaning that the Board is required to prove  that professional\nmisconduct has occurred. A practitioner is not required to 'prove their innocence'. The Board is required to\nprove its case on the balance of probabilities.\nEvidence\nBefore the final hearing, the Board will prepare, file and serve a Tribunal Book:\nIn a contested hearing, this will comprise the material exchanged between the parties.\nIn cases where a final hearing is required after resolution of the matter, the parties will usually agree upon the\ncomposition of the Tribunal Book.\nOral evidence may also be given in proceedings, and is commonly provided by both lay and expert witnesses\n(who will adopt any statement they have made, and be subject to cross-examination).145 The practitioner who\nis the subject of a referral may also decide to give evidence. All evidence given orally at a final hearing is\ngiven on oath or affirmation.\nEven where the conduct the subject of the allegation is admitted by a practitioner, the practitioner may\ndecide to give oral evidence about:\n- the way they have reflected on their actions;\n- their understanding of the consequences of their actions;\n- the context in which their actions were taken; and",

This is\ndiscussed further at 10.2.\nIt can be difficult for some witnesses to attend at the responsible tribunal to give evidence, particularly when\nthey reside interstate or overseas. In some circumstances, the tribunal may grant leave for a witness to give\nevidence by videolink or telephone.\n8.5 Findings and determinations available to a responsible tribunal\nAfter hearing a matter, the responsible tribunal will consider the evidence, make findings of fact and decide\nwhether the allegations are proven. It may then decide:\n- the practitioner has no case to answer and no further action is to be taken about the matter; or\n- one or more of the following:\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes unsatisfactory professional\nperformance;\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes unprofessional conduct;\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes professional misconduct;\no the practitioner has an impairment;\no the practitioner’s registration was improperly obtained because the practitioner or someone\nelse gave the National Board established for the practitioner’s health profession information\nor a document that was false or misleading in a material particular. 146\nThe meanings of the above findings are discussed in detail in Chapter 9.\nDeterminations\nIf a responsible tribunal makes a finding (other than a finding that the practitioner has no case to answer),\nit may:\n- caution or reprimand the practitioner;\n- impose a condition on the practitioner's registration;\n- require the practitioner to pay a fine of not more than $30,000 to the Board that registers the\npractitioner;\n- suspend the practitioner’s registration for a specified period; and/or\n- cancel the practitioner’s registration.147\nIf a responsible tribunal decides to impose a condition on the practitioner's registration, it must also decide a\nreview period of the condition.148\nIf the responsible tribunal decides to cancel a person's registration or the person does not hold registration,\nthe tribunal may also decide to:\n- disqualify the person from applying for registration as a registered health practitioner for a specified\nperiod; or\n- prohibit the person, either permanently or for a stated period, from:\no providing any health service or a specified health service; or\no using any title or a specified title.149\nThe above determinations, and the principles about the imposition of determinations under the National Law,\nare discussed in detail in Chapter 10.",

There are also costs provisions in the enabling acts for each of\nthe responsible tribunals about the awarding of costs that may be considered.150\nAcross the jurisdictions, if a tribunal makes orders substantially in line with those sought by the Board, the\nusual course is for a Board to seek an order that the practitioner pay its costs.  However, the various\nresponsible tribunals vary in their approach to this issue.  For example, in Victoria, the Victorian Civil and\nAdministrative Tribunal has recently stated the primary factor that it considers to be relevant is the nature of\nthe proven conduct and the findings made by it: where it has been established that an individual has been\nfound to have entirely breached their professional obligations, it is appropriate that the practitioner bear the\ncost of the related disciplinary proceedings.151\n8.7 Other matters relevant to tribunal referrals\nAllegations pre-dating the National Law\nFrom time to time, matters will involve conduct occurring before 1 July 2010, which predates the National\nLaw.  In these circumstances, the relevant Board's allegations will be framed as contraventions of the\nNational Law, rather than contraventions of previously historical legislation.\nTo assist in transitioning from prior Acts to the National Law, a number of savings and transitional provisions\nwere introduced.  Relevantly, Regulation 30, which expired on 30 June 2015, provided that if Ahpra received\na notification about a registered health practitioner and the subject matter of the notification occurred while\nthey were registered under a corresponding prior Act, proceedings could be taken under Part 8 of the\nNational Law as if they were registered under the National Law.\nA responsible tribunal was recently required to determine:\n- whether it continued to have jurisdiction to deal with notifications that would have been dealt with\nunder Regulation 30, if it had not expired; and\n- if yes, whether it had power to make findings and determinations that were available at the time of\nthe prior Act, or those available under the National Law.\nIn relation to the first issue, the Tribunal found that the practitioner's contention that the  Board did not have\nthe power to deal with the notification, and therefore the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction would, if accepted,\ncreate anomalous results because the Board would have power to investigate and refer matters involving\nhealth practitioners registered under a corresponding prior Act and under the National Law, but the Tribuna l\nwould have no power to make findings and determinations in relation to them unless the practitioner was not,\nand never had been, registered under the National Law.  Further, during debate in the House of Assembly\nregarding the Bills for introduction of the National Law in Tasmania, the Minister for Health expressly\naccepted that the National Law could be applied to a 'pre-1 July complaint'.  The Tribunal considered that\nthis supported an argument that the National Law applies after the expiration of the s avings and transitional\nprovisions including Regulation 30.\nIn relation to the second issue, the Tribunal relied on Walton v McBride,152 and the following relevant\nprinciples from that case:\n- construction of legislation should take into account its objective, namely, protection of the public;\n- legislation must be given full force and effect according to its terms; and",

Available findings under the National Law\n9.1 Introduction\nAs set out in Chapters 7 and 8, at the end of a performance and professional standards panel (PPSP)\nhearing, or a disciplinary proceeding before a responsible tribunal, the decision-maker will make findings of\nfact and decide how to characterise the matter.\nDecisions that may be made by a PPSP\nOnce it has made findings of fact, a PPSP can decide:\n- the practitioner has no case to answer and no further action is to be taken about the matter; or\n- one or more of the following:\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes unsatisfactory professional\nperformance; or\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes unprofessional conduct; or\no the practitioner must be referred to a responsible tribunal.\nDecisions that may be made by a responsible tribunal\nOnce it has made findings of fact, a responsible tribunal can decide:\n- the practitioner has no case to answer and no further action is to be taken about the matter; or\n- one or more of the following:\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes unsatisfactory professional\nperformance;\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes unprofessional conduct;\no the practitioner has behaved in a way that constitutes professional misconduct;\no the practitioner has an impairment; or\no the practitioner’s registration was improperly obtained because the practitioner or someone\nelse gave the National Board established for the practitioner’s health profession information\nor a document that was false or misleading in a material particular.\nWhen a decision-maker characterises a practitioner’s conduct or health in these terms, they are often\ndescribed as ‘findings’. This is an important step in any proceeding, as it either disposes of (ends) the\nmatter, or will inform what, if any, regulatory action is taken against the practitioner.\nThis chapter will focus predominantly on the terms 'unprofessional conduct', 'professional misconduct'\nand 'unsatisfactory professional performance'. Unsatisfactory professional performance is a subset of\nunprofessional conduct.153 These terms are used in various sections of the National Law; and are defined in\nsection 5. These various findings reflect the nature and/or the severity of the matter.\n9.2 Professional standards\nWhat are professional standards?\nKEY POINTS\n- The concept of 'professional standards' is relevant to any disciplinary proceeding under the National Law in\nwhich a decision-maker is asked to make a finding of unsatisfactory professional performance,\nunprofessional conduct or professional misconduct.\n- These terms are defined by reference to the standard 'expected' of a practitioner by:\no their professional peers;\no the public; and/or\no a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience.\n- The ‘standard’ expected of a practitioner can be worked out by reference to, for example:\no Board standards, policies, codes and guidelines;\no employer/government department policies, standards, codes and guidelines;",

Of course, this will depend on what the document is and the identity of\nthe entity that published it.\nWhen reliance is placed on a document created by a third party, it is common (though not necessarily\nrequired, depending on the decision-maker or tribunal) for it to be produced by a witness from the relevant\nentity (who might be in a position to explain the document and how it was developed).  This may depend on\nwhat the document is, and the identity of the entity that published it.\nRole of expert evidence\nA Board might be required to lead expert evidence to establish a relevant professional standard.  'Expert\nevidence' refers to opinion evidence provided by an independent person who has specialised knowledge\nof a subject by reason of their training, study or experience that informs that opinion.",

The concept of 'fit and proper' is discussed in\nmore detail at 9.5.\n9.3 Meaning of unprofessional conduct\nKEY POINTS\n- Unprofessional conduct is defined to mean professional conduct that is of a lesser standard than that which\nmight reasonably be expected of the health practitioner by the public or the practitioner’s professional\npeers.\n- The definition of the term also deems specific types of conduct to be unprofessional conduct, and includes\nspecific instances where conduct occurring outside of the practitioner's practice of the profession can be\nthe subject of regulatory action.\nSection 5 of the National Law sets out the definitions of specific terms. It states that:\nunprofessional conduct, of a registered health practitioner, means professional conduct that is of\na lesser standard than that which might reasonably be expected of the health practitioner by the\npublic or the practitioner’s professional peers, and includes:\n(a) a contravention by the practitioner of the National Law, whether or not the practitioner has\nbeen prosecuted for, or convicted of, an offence in relation to the contravention; and\n(b) a contravention by the practitioner of—\ni. a condition to which the practitioner’s registration was subject; or\nii. an undertaking given by the practitioner to the National Board that registers the\npractitioner; and\n(c) the conviction of the practitioner for an offence under another Act, the nature of which\nmay affect the practitioner’s suitability to continue to practise the profession; and\n(d) providing a person with health services of a kind that are excessive, unnecessary or\notherwise not reasonably required for the person’s well-being; and\n(e) influencing, or attempting to influence, the conduct of another registered health\npractitioner in a way that may compromise patient care; and\n(f) accepting a benefit as inducement, consideration or reward for referring another person to\na health service provider or recommending another person use or consult with a health\nservice provider; and",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 60\nRelationship between ‘unsatisfactory professional performance’ and ‘unprofessional conduct’\nUnsatisfactory professional performance is considered to be equally as serious as, though different to,\nunprofessional conduct. All matters that come before the Board relate to 'behaviour' or ‘conduct’ in a general\nsense. A notification or complaint will identify an act or omission of the practitioner that the notifier has taken\nissue with or wants to bring to the Board’s attention. For this reason, ‘unsatisfactory professional\nperformance’ has been described as 'a subset of unprofessional conduct'. 157 The decision-maker is\nconsidering 'conduct', just through a different lens.\nThe definition of unsatisfactory professional performance is arguably narrower than the definition of\nunprofessional conduct. While the definition of ‘unprofessional conduct’ applies to any behaviour that is\nconsidered ‘professional conduct’, the definition of ‘unsatisfactory professional performance' is limited to:\n- the ‘knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised’ by a practitioner’; and\n- only when it occurs in the practice of the profession in which the practitioner is registered.\nBecause the difference between ‘unprofessional conduct’ and ‘unsatisfactory professional performance’ is\none of perspective (that is, the ‘lens’ applied to the ‘behaviour’ or ‘conduct’ before the Board), it is important\nto note that a substantial departure from expected professional standards will still need to be considered with\nreference to the definitions of professional misconduct. For example, ‘behaviour’ or ‘conduct’ that may be\nconsidered to be a serious example of ‘unsatisfactory professional performance’ may require consideration\nunder definitions (a) or (c) of ‘professional misconduct’.\nExample of unsatisfactory professional performance\nEXAMPLE\nFailure to establish and maintain adequate system for recording clinical notes and managing and\nresponding to test results\nFACTS DECISION\nA medical practitioner was found to have, among\nother things:\n- failed to establish and maintain an adequate\nsystem for ensuring that test results and other\nclinical correspondence received by him were\nacted on in a timely manner (including systems for\nfollowing up, and protecting against failing to follow\nup, test results and clinical correspondence).\n- failed to establish and maintain an adequate\nsystem for recording and storing patient clinical\nrecords.\nThe responsible tribunal made findings of unsatisfactory\nprofessional performance about each of these issues.

This definition is designed to apply to\nany conduct, whether it occurs inside or outside the practice of the profession.\nThe definition of professional misconduct is expressed as 'including' the categories of conduct described in\nsubparagraphs (a), (b) and (c). It is also common for responsible tribunals to refer to the relevant common\nlaw principles applicable to the concept of professional misconduct as a means of interpreting the statutory\ndefinition. 'Common law' refers to legal principles developed through past decisions of courts and tribunals,\nas opposed to laws created by Parliament through legislation, such as the National Law.\nThe concept of professional misconduct exists in the common law, currently and historically, about some\nregistered professions. Some of the more well-known common law statements describing professional\nmisconduct in its various forms (at common law and in earlier legislation) are set out in the table below.\nDecision Comments\nConduct that departs from professional standards\nQidwai v Brown [1984] 1\nNSWLR 100 at 105, per\nPriestley JA\nPriestley JA held that the test for whether a practitioner has committed\n'misconduct in a professional respect' is whether 'the practitioner was in such\nbreach of the written or unwritten rules of the profession as would reasonably incur\nthe strong reprobation of professional brethren of good repute and competence'.\nMyers v Elman [1940] AC 282\nat 288-289, per Viscount\nMaugham\nViscount Maugham affirmed that a solicitor could be struck off the rolls or\nsuspended on the ground of 'professional misconduct', words which he found\n'have been properly defined as conduct which would reasonably be regarded\nas disgraceful or dishonourable by solicitors of good repute and competency'.\nCampbell v Dental Board of\nVictoria [1999] VSC 113 at\n[23]-[24], per Mandie J\n'The test to be applied is whether the conduct violates or falls short of, to a\nsubstantial degree, the standard of professional conduct observed or approved\nby members of the profession of good repute and competency.’\nConduct inconsistent with being a fit and proper person to hold registration\nNSW Bar Association v\nCummins [2001] NSWCA 284,\nper Spigelman CJ\n'There is authority in favour of extending the terminology “professional misconduct”\nto acts not occurring directly in the course of professional practice. That is not to say\nthat any form of personal misconduct may be regarded as professional misconduct.\nThe authorities appear to me to suggest two kinds of relationships that justify\napplying the terminology in this broader way. First, acts may be sufficiently closely\nconnected with actual practice, albeit not occurring in the course of such practice.\nSecondly, conduct outside the course of practice may manifest the presence or\nabsence of qualities which are incompatible with, or essential for, the conduct of\npractice. In this second case, the terminology of “professional misconduct” overlaps\nwith and, usually it is not necessary to distinguish it from, the terminology of “good\nfame and character” or “fit and proper person\".’\nA Solicitor v Council of the\nLaw Society NSW [2004] HCA\n1 per Gleeson CJ, McHugh,\nGummow, Kirby and Callinan\nJJ at 267\n'… even though conduct was not engaged in directly in the course of professional\npractice, it may be so connected to such practice as to amount to professional\nmisconduct. Furthermore, even where it does not involve professional misconduct a\nperson's behaviour may demonstrate qualities of a kind that require a conclusion\nthat a person is not a fit and proper person to practise.’",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 64\nGriersmith illustrates the point that whether the conduct is inconsistent with the practitioner being a fit\nand proper person must be considered in the context of what they are permitted to do, if they are registered.\nFor example, personal conduct which is not unlawful or the subject of a criminal finding may still form the\nbasis of a finding under subparagraph (c) if it is indicative of the practitioner possessing qualities which\nare incompatible with their profession, or indicative of the absence of qualities that are essential to that\nprofession.\nWhether occurring in connection with their practice or not\nProfessional misconduct under subparagraph (c) is expressly defined as being inclusive of conduct that is\nnot connected with the person's practice of the profession (personal conduct). It captures all conduct that is\ninconsistent with a practitioner being a fit and proper person to hold registration.\nRelationship between finding under paragraph (c) and determinations\nCancellation of a practitioner's registration can often follow a finding of professional misconduct under\nsubparagraph (c). However, this is not inevitably the case. A decision that a practitioner has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct under subparagraph (c) does not have the automatic effect of cancelling, or\notherwise requiring the responsible tribunal to interfere with, a practitioner’s registration.\nSubparagraph (c) refers to conduct that it is 'inconsistent with a practitioner being a fit and proper person to\nhold registration in the profession'. This is a characterisation of the conduct the practitioner has engaged in. It\nis not an assessment of whether the practitioner is fit and proper to hold registration at the time the\nresponsible tribunal is considering the matter, and arriving at its determinations. As discussed in Chapter 10,\nthere are a range of matters a responsible tribunal must consider when arriving at a determination.\nExamples of professional misconduct\nThe following examples are of the types of conduct which have recently been found to constitute professional\nmisconduct under the National Law by various responsible tribunals.\nAs with the earlier examples, these examples are not a definitive guide as to whether a certain kind of\nconduct is characterised in a certain way. All cases turn on their own facts. Often tribunals will assess the\nsame 'type' of conduct differently based on the individual facts and circumstances.\nEXAMPLE 1\nNon-sexual boundary breach – over-involvement in patient's affairs; failure to manage a conflict\nof interest; breach of the relevant code of conduct\nFACTS FINDING\nA nurse was found to have:\n- transgressed the boundaries that should, and ordinarily\ndo, exist between a registered nurse and a patient in\nthat she was overly involved in the affairs of a patient\nand failed to adequately manage a conflict of interest\n(Allegation 1);\n- failed to manage a conflict of interest in that she\nobtained a benefit under a patient's will in circumstances\nwhere she knew, before his death, that he intended to\nname her as a beneficiary (Allegation 2); and\n- failed to practise the profession of nursing in a reflective\nmanner in that she failed to have regard to the views and\nbeliefs expressed by her colleagues (Allegation 3).\nThe responsible tribunal found that each of the\nallegations constituted professional misconduct within\nthe meaning of subparagraph (c) of the definition. In\nmaking this finding, the tribunal had regard to the Code\nof professional conduct for nurses in Australia, the\nNurses’ guide to professional boundaries and A code of\nethics for nurses in Australia.",

    "text": "Distinction between unnecessary clinical examinations and sexual misconduct\nFrequently, there is a question in referral proceedings about how certain conduct involving an intimate\nclinical examination ought to be characterised, namely whether it is an unnecessary examination (and\ntherefore indicative, perhaps, of a performance issue), or deliberate sexual misconduct of a very serious\nnature.  For example, where a practitioner has ostensibly performed an internal vaginal examination on a\npatient that is not clinically justified in the circumstances, there is often a question about w hether, in fact, a\nsexual assault or rape has taken place (instead of merely an unnecessary examination).\nIt is the position of Ahpra and the Boards that, while there may be competing explanations or purported\ncharacterisations of the conduct, most if not all of these explanations involve a serious abuse of trust and are\nan extremely serious example of misconduct.  Even if it is not possible to positively establish that an\nexamination was conducted for a sexual purpose (in the subjective mind of the practitioner), an unwarranted\nexamination or one which was conducted in the absence of fully informed consent may nonetheless\nconstitute a sexual boundary violation.159  In a recent decision, a responsible tribunal reached a similar\nconclusion.\n9.6 Other findings\nThe National Law also includes other findings that can be made by a panel or responsible tribunal.  These are\ndiscussed below.\nThere are more potential findings available to a responsible tribunal than a panel. 160 This is because more\nserious conduct is required to be referred to a responsible tribunal.\nNo case to answer\nA potential finding of a PPSP or responsible tribunal is that the practitioner 'has no case to answer and no\nfurther action is to be taken about the matter'.161",

The health assessment process is discussed in more detail at 4.2.\nA decision-maker may also review medical evidence from other sources, for example, reports produced by a\npractitioner or clinical records.\nA finding that a practitioner has an impairment is a result of the decision-maker's assessment at the time of its\ndecision. Such a finding will not be made, for example, because a practitioner may have had an impairment\nin the past.\nRelationship to misconduct\nIt is important to note that a finding that a practitioner has an impairment will not preclude that practitioner\nalso being found to have engaged in professional misconduct or unprofessional conduct.  Conduct that\nconstitutes professional misconduct or unprofessional conduct does not cease to be such because it is\ncaused by an impairment (such as a substance misuse disorder). However, the existence of an impairment\nmay explain the conduct.",

This is because:\n- paragraph (c) of the definition of ‘unprofessional conduct’ deems a specific class of criminal finding\nto be ‘unprofessional conduct’ (which may subsequently meet the definition set out in paragraph (a)\nof professional misconduct); and\n- criminal conduct may meet the definition set out in paragraph (c) of professional misconduct.\nGenerally, if a criminal finding of guilt has been made against the practitioner/a practitioner has accepted\nresponsibility for the conduct, the disciplinary proceeding will proceed on the facts as found and/or admitted\nin the criminal proceeding.\nWhether the conviction of a practitioner is sufficient to fall within paragraph (a) or (c) of the definition of\nprofessional misconduct will depend on the nature and circumstances of the offence. Serious offences such\nas murder or sexual assault will generally amount to professional misconduct. On the other hand, minor\ndriving offences are unlikely to meet the definition. Between these extremes are a range of offences that may\nor may not meet the definition depending on the circumstances. For example, a fraud conviction is likely to\namount to professional misconduct if it is particularly serious (taking into account the size of the fraud, the\nimpact on the victims etc) however it is possible that in other cases the circumstances of the offence would\nnot be serious enough to amount to professional misconduct.\nIn some instances, the Board may start a disciplinary proceeding even if the practitioner:\n- was not charged; or\n- was charged, but was not found guilty.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 74\n10. Determinations under the National Law\n10.1 Introduction\n'Determinations', 'sanctions' or 'penalties' refer to the actions available to a decision -maker under the National\nLaw once a finding has been made about a practitioner. This chapter will:\n- set out the relevant principles that apply, in a general sense, to determinations under the National\nLaw;\n- explain the various determinations that may be imposed;\n- focus on determinations that may be imposed at the conclusion of the conduct and performance\nsettings – that is, those imposed by a performance and professional standards panel ( PPSP) or a\nresponsible tribunal.\nThis chapter will not consider the regulatory action that may be taken by Boards about health under the\nhealth assessment process and/or health panel process (discussed in Chapters 4 and 7).\nFurther, this chapter does not explicitly consider the regulatory action that may be taken by Boards under\nsection 178 of the National Law. However, the general themes of this chapter are informed by:\n- when or why a Board may take regulatory action under that section; and\n- the purpose of the regulatory action a Board may take under that section.\nThis chapter generally refers to the relevant decision-maker as being a responsible tribunal. However, a\nPPSP (as discussed in Chapter 7), also has the power to take action about a practitioner’s registration. The\ngeneral principles discussed in this chapter are relevant to, and inform, the PPSP process.\nDeterminations that may be made by a responsible tribunal\nOnce a responsible tribunal has made a finding or findings about a practitioner's conduct, performance or\nhealth, it may then also decide to:\n- caution or reprimand the practitioner;\n- impose a condition on the practitioner's registration;\n- require the practitioner to pay a fine of not more than $30,000 to the relevant Board that registers the\npractitioner;\n- suspend the practitioner's registration for a specified period; or\n- cancel the practitioner's registration.166\nIf a responsible tribunal decides to cancel a practitioner's registration (or the practitioner is not registered at\nthe time of the tribunal's decision), the tribunal may also decide to:\n- disqualify the practitioner from applying for registration for a specified period; or\n- prohibit them, either permanently or for a stated period, from:\no providing any health service or a specified health service; or\no using any title or a specified title.167\nDeterminations that may be made by a PPSP\nOnce a PPSP has made a finding or findings about a practitioner's conduct or performance, it may then also\ndecide to:\n- caution or reprimand the practitioner; and/or\n- impose a condition on the practitioner's registration.",

    "text": "'Protection of the public' is the primary purpose of a determination. This is distinct from the concept of\n'punishment'.168 However, regardless of this distinction, determinations will almost invariably carry subjective\nfeelings of punishment for the practitioner concerned. This is unavoidable. The feeling of being 'punished'\nis one of the features of a determination that may assist it to achieve its primary purpose.\nSection 32(a) of the National Law provides that the objectives of the National Registration and Accreditation\nScheme include 'to provide for the protection of the public by ensuring that only health practitioners who are\nsuitably trained and qualified to practise in a competent and ethical manner are registered'.  Section 3(a)\nprovides that 'restrictions on the practice of a health profession are to be imposed under the scheme only\nif it is necessary to ensure health services are provided safely and are of an appropriate quality'.\nProtection of the public\n‘Protection of the public’ is the paramount consideration of a responsible tribunal or PPSP when deciding\nthe appropriate disciplinary action to take. This concept is not defined, can mean many different things and\ncan be achieved in a variety of ways. For example, the NSW Nursing and Midwifery Tribunal has\ncommented that:\n- the 'protection' may be:\no 'protection from actual harm caused by health practitioners who do not meet the standards\nrequired by law and codes of conduct'; and/or\no 'protection from a culture of sub-standard practice or lacking in professional ethics from\nwhich harm may flow';169\n- this ‘protection’ may be achieved by taking a form of regulatory action 'intended to bring home to the\npractitioner the seriousness of the practitioner's departure from professional standards, and intended\nto deter the practitioner from any further departure'.170 This concept is known as specific\ndeterrence, and is discussed further in chapter 11 below.\n- this ‘protection’ may be made 'to emphasise to other members of the profession, or to reassure the\npublic, that a certain type of conduct is not acceptable'.171\nA determination which acts to warn other members of the profession against engaging in certain\nconduct (due to the disciplinary consequences which may follow) has the effect of general\ndeterrence, which is discussed further in chapter11.\nA determination which acts to 'reassure the public' that a certain type of conduct is not acceptable is\nassisting to protect the profession and maintain professional standards by demonstrating that the\nrelevant profession does not allow certain conduct. This also serves the public interest by providing\nreassurance that appropriate standards are being maintained within the relevant profession.  These\nconcepts are discussed further in chapter 11.\nUltimately, determinations under the National Law (and the disciplinary process more broadly) can operate to\nprotect the public in a variety of ways, depending on the facts and circumstances of the matter.\nThe concept of ‘protection of the public’ is often contrasted with the concept of ‘punitive purpose’ ( that is, to\npunish). It is accepted that the ‘protection of the public’ does not hold the ‘punishment of the practitioner’ as\nits primary focus. However, regardless of this distinction, determinations still cause the practitioner to feel like\nthey have been punished.",

A caution is\nnot usually recorded on the national register, though may be if the Board considers it appropriate to do so.\nAs such, a caution is generally intended to protect the public by way of specific deterrence –  a practitioner is\nwarned not to engage in certain conduct in the future.\nEXAMPLE 1\nPractitioner failed to assist member of public – caution\nFACTS\nA medical practitioner was found to have\nacted improperly by falsely advising a member\nof the public (who was seeking medical\nassistance for her child) that he was not a\ndoctor.

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 77\nReprimand\nKEY POINTS\n- A reprimand is a formal and public denunciation of a practitioner's conduct, which is recorded on the public\nregister of practitioners.\n- A reprimand will be appropriate where there is a need for general, as well as specific, deterrence.\n- A PPSP or a responsible tribunal may reprimand a practitioner.\nA reprimand is a formal way of rebuking or expressing disapproval to a practitioner, and the public, for the\npractitioner’s conduct. Unlike a caution, which is a reminder not to engage in similar conduct in the future\nand is generally not published on the national register of practitioners, a reprimand is:\n- an official and public rebuke for past conduct;\n- recorded on the national register of practitioners; and\n- not trivial and considered to be more serious than a caution. 172\nEXAMPLE 1\nExcessive prescribing of anabolic steroids – reprimand\nFACTS\nA medical practitioner was found to have\nprescribed clinically inappropriate and excessive\namounts of testosterone to a patient, over a\nperiod of over two years. The practitioner's\nprescribing was also the subject of criminal\nprosecution in the Magistrates' Court (relating\nto two breaches of the Drugs Poisons and\nControlled Substances Regulations 2006 (Vic),\nto which the practitioner pleaded guilty).\nFINDING\nProfessional misconduct under subparagraph\n(a) of the definition.\nDETERMINATION\nThe practitioner was reprimanded.\nRELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS\nIn arriving at its determination, the responsible tribunal took into\naccount that:\n- almost five years had elapsed between the conduct taking\nplace and the matter coming before the tribunal; and\n- the practitioner had:\n– voluntarily completed extensive further education to\naddress his lack of knowledge about the prescribing of\nanabolic steroids;\n– put measures in place within his practice to reduce the risk\nof similar conduct taking place; and\n– demonstrated appropriate insight and remorse.\nThe responsible tribunal ultimately considered that conditions that\nmight otherwise have been imposed on the practitioner's\nregistration were not necessary, and that a reprimand was the\nmost appropriate determination.\nConditions\nKEY POINTS\n- Conditions restrict a practitioner's practice in some way, such as by requiring them to do something, or\npreventing them from doing something, in their profession.\n- The National Restrictions Library provides standard form wording for common types of conditions.",

However, in circumstances\nwhere a condition has been imposed because the practitioner has an impairment, the Board has discretion\nto not publish it if:\n- it is necessary to protect the practitioner’s privacy; and\n- there is no overriding public interest for the condition to be recorded.173\nCommon examples of conditions include those requiring the practitioners to:\n- complete further education or training;\n- only practise under the supervision of another practitioner;\n- do, or refrain from doing, something in connection with the practitioner’s practice (such a prohibition\non prescribing certain medications);\n- manage their practice or place of practice in a specified way;\n- report to a named person (such as an employer) at specified times while practising, or not employ,\nengage or recommend or work with a specified person, or class of people;\n- submit to drug screening and refrain from drug use (except for prescribed medications);\n- submit to alcohol breath testing at the workplace; and\n- be supervised by a treating practitioner.\nIf a PPSP or responsible tribunal decides to impose a condition on a practitioner's registration, it must also\ndecide a 'review period' for the condition. At the conclusion of the review period, the relevant Board will\nreview whether the conditions are still required.\nPurpose of conditions\nGenerally speaking, the primary purpose of conditions (as a final form of disciplinary action) is  to:\n- manage the risk posed by a practitioner by restricting their practice; and / or\n- assist in facilitating the rehabilitation of a practitioner; and\n- enable ongoing monitoring regarding the practitioner’s compliance with the conditions.\nNational Restrictions Library\nThe National Restrictions Library (NRL) is a document published by Ahpra which provides standard form\nwording for common types of conditions.

If a practitioner’s registration is cancelled:\no It sends a clear message that they are unsuitable to hold registration; and\no there is no guarantee of re-registration, if they apply at a later date.\nSuspension\nA practitioner whose registration is suspended by a responsible tribunal cannot practise or work as a\nregistered health practitioner in that profession, in any Australian state or territory, until the suspension\nlapses. For example, if a responsible tribunal orders a one-month suspension, the suspension would lapse at\nthe conclusion of that time. Once a suspension lapses, the practitioner's right to practise is automatically\nreinstated. In some instances, the period of suspension might start immediately. At other times, a responsible\ntribunal might specify a start date for the suspension.\nCancellation\nA practitioner whose registration has been cancelled by a responsible tribunal cannot practi se or work as a\nregistered health practitioner in that profession, in any Australian state or territory.  A practitioner must re-\napply for registration if they wish to work as a registered health practitioner in that profession again.\nDifference between suspension and cancellation\nCancellation and suspension are both very serious outcomes for a practitioner. The primary difference\nbetween cancellation and suspension is that:\n- at the completion of a period of suspension, a practitioner is permitted to return to practise\nunrestricted (or with any restrictions that were imposed on their registration); and\n- following cancellation of their registration, a practitioner can only return to practise following a\nsuccessful application for registration. There is no guarantee that such an application will be\nsuccessful.\nCancellation will generally be preferred where:\n- the practitioner is unsuitable to practise; and/or\n- the gravity of the conduct was so serious, cancellation is necessary.\nSuspension will generally be preferred where:\n- the gravity of the conduct warrants it; and\n- there is confidence in the practitioner’s future ability to practise once the period of suspension is\nserved.",

    "text": "How a decision-maker arrives at a determination\nSome of the principles or factors discussed in this chapter will be given more or less we ight than others\n(or not considered at all), depending on the facts and circumstances of the matter.  This guide provides\ngeneral information only. Each responsible tribunal has its own procedures and requirements. Consequently,\nthese principles may be considered explicitly, or merely provide a background against which a decision is\nmade.\nThe decision-maker is to consider its determination, and what disciplinary action is appropriate, by\nreference to:\n- the conduct; and\n- facts and circumstances at the date of the decision;\nnot by reference to the facts and circumstances as they were at the date of the conduct only.  This is because\nwhat is appropriate, might be informed by facts/circumstances that have arisen in the intervening period.\nThe determination process requires the decision-maker to balance different (and often competing) principles\nand factors to arrive at disciplinary action that properly and appropriately 'protects the public'. These same\nconsiderations inform the submissions that may be made on behalf of a Board in disciplinary proceedings\nbefore a responsible tribunal.\nGeneral principles\nSpecific deterrence\nIn the disciplinary context ‘specific deterrence’ is the concept of discouraging a practitioner who has\nengaged in misconduct from engaging in further misconduct.\nIf a decision-maker cannot be satisfied that the practitioner has acquired adequate insight/remorse into his\nor her conduct; and/or is at risk of engaging in similar misconduct again, specific deterrence may be given\nmore weight by the decision-maker when arriving at its determination.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 92\nConversely, if a practitioner has demonstrated sufficient insight or remorse, a decision- maker might be\nsatisfied that the risk of engaging in similar misconduct again is low, and specific deterrence may be given\nlittle, if any weight.\nOther factors may be relevant to assessing specific deterrence. Some of these are discussed in more detail\nin the rest of this chapter.\nGeneral deterrence\nIn a disciplinary context ‘general deterrence’ is the concept of discouraging other practitioners and\nmembers of the profession from engaging in misconduct of the kind before the decision- maker. It is an\nunderstanding that misconduct followed by adverse consequences for the practitioner who engaged in it will\nprevent other practitioners engaging in the same or similar misconduct.\nGeneral deterrence may be given more weight when there is a greater potential for harm to be caused as a\nresult of the behaviour. More serious conduct may require a more serious determination in the interests of\ngeneral deterrence.\nProtection of the profession and maintenance of professional standards\nThe maintenance of professional standards, and/or the protection of the profession (that is, maintaining\nits standing in the community), is sometimes expressed as a separate objective of determinations under the\nNational Law. Put simply, the protection of the public requires the maintenance of adequate professional\nstandards.\nDeterminations which protect the profession and/or maintain professional standards uphold the public's\nconfidence in the relevant profession.\nRehabilitation\nThere is a broad public interest in ensuring that, when appropriate, people with special skills who breach the\nstandards of their profession are rehabilitated and returned to practise. In some circumstances, this may\ncause a responsible tribunal to focus more on a determination that assists the rehabilitation of the identified\ndeficit (for example, by imposing conditions on the practitioner’s registration).\nHowever, this proposition must be balanced against the other competing principles, factors and\nconsiderations at play – remembering ‘protection of the public’ is the primary purpose of the determination\nprocess. Taking this on board, owing to, for example:\n- the seriousness of the misconduct engaged in;\n- the number of instances of misconduct (that is, whether the conduct is a 'one-off');\n- a previous disciplinary history; or\n- a lack of insight or remorse on the part of the practitioner,\n‘rehabilitation of the practitioner’ may work against the practitioner, or alternatively be given little, if any\nweight.\nFor example, a responsible tribunal might form the view that a practitioner is unlikely to ever be rehabilitated,\nor at least, unlikely to be rehabilitated in a foreseeable period of time (such that cancellation is required).\nAlternatively, a responsible tribunal might accept that a practitioner has good prospects of being\nrehabilitated, but cancellation is required in the interests of general deterrence, protection of the\nprofession/maintenance of professional standards.\nChoice of determinations\nWhere there is a choice of appropriate determinations, the responsible tribunal should choose that or those\nthat maximise the protection of the public.\nParity in determinations\nWhile it is in the public interest (particularly in the context of a national scheme) for there to be general parity\n(or consistency) in determinations imposed for conduct of a particular kind, each case must be decided on its\nown facts. Ultimately, the appropriate disciplinary consequence must be determined considering:\n- what is necessary and appropriate to protect the public and the profession; and\n- the particular circumstances of the case.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 93\nGlobal determinations\nA decision-maker can take a 'global' approach to determinations (rather than imposing a separate\ndetermination for each finding of misconduct). This may be more appropriate where the conduct the subject\nof the various allegations is part of a general course of conduct, making it difficult or artificial to deal with\neach allegation on its own.\nParamountcy of public protection\nThe COAG Health Council has issued Policy Direction 2019-1 to the Boards and Ahpra. This policy direction\naffirms the paramountcy of public protection and specifically requires the Boards and Ahpra to:\n- take into account the potential impact of the practitioner’s conduct on the public (including\nvulnerable people) and consider the extent to which deterring other practitioners from participating\nin similar conduct would support the protection of the public and engender confidence in the\nregulated profession;\n- when considering whether conduct may be unprofessional conduct or professional misconduct, give\nat least equal weight to the expectations of the public as well as professional peers about the\nexpected standards of practice;\n- when considering the nature of regulatory action to be taken, or sanctions sought, ensure that the\nrisk that the practitioner poses to the public and the need for effective deterrence outweigh the\npotential impact upon the practitioner.\nFactors that may be relevant to decision-making\nInsight and remorse\nKEY POINTS\n- Insight (a practitioner's acceptance and understanding of their wrongdoing) and remorse (a practitioner's\ngenuine regret of the harm they did, or might have, caused) are both relevant to the extent to how heavily\nspecific deterrence weighs in the determinations process.\n- The most effective way for a decision-maker to assess the level of insight or remorse demonstrated by a\npractitioner is by hearing direct evidence from the practitioner.\nThe degree to which a practitioner has acquired insight into their conduct is relevant to determinations, as\nthis relates to the ongoing risk posed by the practitioner. Insight in this context refers to a practitioner's\nunderstanding and awareness of their conduct, including:\n- an acceptance that the conduct was below the expected standard;\n- an understanding of the ways in which the conduct was below the expected standard;\n- an appreciation of the circumstances which led to the conduct and an understanding of  the\nconsequences; and\n- a willingness to take measures to identify risk factors, and to do what is necessary to avoid further\ntransgressions.\nIn this context, a practitioner who has gained genuine insight into their conduct is, in principle, less likely to\nengage in misconduct again. It is therefore relevant to how much weight a decision-maker gives to specific\ndeterrence. It will also inform a decision-maker's assessment of whether a practitioner is readily capable of\nbeing rehabilitated, and therefore whether a rehabilitation-focused determination is appropriate.\nIn some circumstances, that a practitioner has demonstrated appropriate remorse (that is, they regret their\nconduct) may similarly be relevant. However, for a responsible tribunal to be satisfied that a practitioner's\nremorse has the effect of reducing their risk to the community, it must also be satisfied that the demonstrated\nremorse is:\n- genuine (that is, not self-serving); and\n- coupled with appropriate insight.\nA practitioner who regrets their conduct only because of the consequences to themselves, will unlikely be\ntaken to have demonstrated sufficient insight and remorse.\nAssessing insight and remorse",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 94\nAssessing the degree of genuine insight or remorse demonstrated by a practitioner can be a difficult\nexercise, depending on the quality of evidence available.\nOne means by which insight and remorse might be assessed is through the use of medical evidence, such as\nfrom a treating psychologist or psychiatrist, who has discussed the conduct with the practitioner in a clinical\nsetting. The other more direct way to assess insight and remorse is by direct evidence from the practitioner.\nA practitioner the subject of a disciplinary proceeding is not required to give evidence if they do not wish to\ndo so. However, in the event that there is no evidence of insight, or the evidence relied upon by the\npractitioner is not up-to-date, the tribunal may have difficulty in balancing this factor in favour of the\npractitioner.\nCharacter evidence\nKEY POINTS\n- Character references are commonly relied upon in disciplinary proceedings under the National Law, and\nthe weight that is placed on this evidence will vary.\n- Character references will be given less weight if it is not clear whether the referee is fully apprised of the\ndetails of the practitioner's conduct.\nPractitioners in disciplinary proceedings under the National Law commonly rely on character references,\nabout both issues of fact, and submissions on the appropriate determination. 'Character references' usually\nrefer to letters or affidavits from senior professional colleagues or community associates, in support of a\npractitioner's 'good character'.\nThe weight that is placed on these references by a decision-maker will vary, though they are generally\nconsidered to be relevant. A character reference is unlikely to be given much (if any) weight if it is unclear\nwhat the referee knows about the conduct that is the subject of the proceeding.\nDelay\nKEY POINTS\n- Delay between the commencement of the disciplinary process and the final hearing can be relevant.\n- The relevance of delay to a decision-maker's determination will depend, in part, on the reasons for the\ndelay; and what has transpired over the period of the delay.\nThe period of time that passes from receipt of a notification, to the start of a disciplinary proceeding, to a\ndecision-maker making a final determination (by way of resolution or not), can be lengthy. It is often\ndescribed by decision-makers as ‘delay’.\n‘Delay’ can be due to many factors, ranging from the inherent complexity of the investigation to the\navailability of responsible tribunals and panels to hear and determine the matter. This passing of time is often\nunavoidable. Considered on its own, it is generally not relevant to a determination.  However, it can become\nrelevant if, for example:\n- it is coupled with a practitioner developing appropriate insight or not developing any insight; and/or\n- the effect it has had on the practitioner (such as feelings of anxiety and uncertainty) is sufficient for\nthe purposes of specific deterrence.\nThe weight a decision-maker will give to ‘delay’ will also depend, in part, on the reasons for it. For example,\nif the practitioner is partially or wholly responsible for the delay, the effect it has had on the practitioner may\nbe of reduced relevance.\nPersonal circumstances\nKEY POINTS\n- Matters personal to a practitioner at the time of a determination (such as financial difficulties or family\nstressors) can be relevant when considering specific deterrence.\n- The relevance of a practitioner’s personal circumstances at the time of the misconduct will usually be linked\nwith other factors such as insight.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 95\nPersonal matters at the time of the determination considered, for example, shame, the negative experience\nof being subject to disciplinary proceedings and the potential financial consequences of a determination, are\nlikely to be of relevance only to the extent that they contribute to the deterrent objective of the di sciplinary\nprocess (for example, specific deterrence).\nThe personal circumstances of a practitioner that led to the misconduct can provide context to the decision-\nmaker, when considering insight, the general principles and what weight to attribute to them.  While the\npractitioner’s personal circumstances may assist in explaining a practitioner's conduct, they are unlikely to\njustify or rationalise a departure from expected professional standards. For example:\n- Where those circumstances identify a specific risk factor that led to the conduct in question, such as\noverwork, the decision-maker may use this to inform what determinations are necessary to control\nthat risk (for example, the imposition of a condition directed at controlling this risk factor, such as\nsupervision or reduced hours).\n- Where those circumstances identify:\no a stressor that led to the practitioner making a poor decision;\no that the practitioner has no insight into that stressor and has taken no steps to resolve or\ncontrol it,\nthis may assist the decision-maker when deciding what weight to give to specific deterrence (for\nexample, it may cause a decision-maker to consider the practitioner an ongoing risk, and that more\nweight needs to be given to specific deterrence).\n- If an inexperienced practitioner who engaged in unsatisfactory professional performance did so in\ncircumstances where:\no they would have benefited from support or supervision; and\no that lack of supervision and support contributed to their conduct,\nthen a decision-maker may consider a ‘rehabilitative’ determination is appropriate (for example, a\ndecision-maker might feel confident that the conduct would not be repeated if the practitioner was\nadequately supervised and supported, and impose conditions to this effect).",

For example:\n- The presence of a mental health condition at the time of the misconduct may assist the decision-\nmaker to understand and assess:\no whether the practitioner has insight into their condition or the circumstances that\nprecipitated their conduct;\no the risk of that conduct recurring; and\no what determinations may be necessary to protect against that risk;\n- The presence of an unmanaged substance abuse disorder the time of the determinations hearing,\nmay assist the decision-maker to understand and assess:\no the capacity of the practitioner to return to work and/or comply with conditions on their\nregistration; and\no what form of determination may ultimately be appropriate.\nFor example, the presence of a significant addiction, with inadequate evidence that it is being sufficiently\nmanaged, may mean that cancellation is effectively the only appropriate determination.\nDisciplinary history\nKEY POINTS\n- That a practitioner has previously been subject to disciplinary action is likely to be relevant to a decision-\nmaker's assessment of the risk to the community posed by a practitioner.\n- Conversely, the fact that a practitioner has been practising for a long period of time and does not have a\nprior disciplinary history might assist a decision-maker in feeling comfortable that the misconduct was an\nisolated occurrence.\nThe fact that a practitioner has previously been subject to disciplinary action is likely to be relevant to a\ndecision-maker's determination.

For example, a decision-maker may view:\n- an extensive disciplinary history as evidencing of the practitioner’s attitude to their professional\nobligations; and/or\n- a disciplinary history involving similar conduct, as:\no evidence that past (and potentially more lenient) disciplinary action has failed;\no inconsistent with any submission that the practitioner has gained insight into their conduct;\nand/or\no indicative that a practitioner is not capable of being rehabilitated.\nConversely, the fact that a practitioner has been practising for a long period of time and does not have a prior\ndisciplinary history may also be relevant.

    "text": "12. Procedural fairness\n12.1 Introduction\nKEY POINTS\n- Procedural fairness is a legal principle which requires fairness in the process that is used in making\ndecisions that may affect a person's rights or interests.\n- Procedural fairness is relevant to the steps that national law bodies take in approaching regulatory decision-\nmaking.  Procedural fairness is not the same as whether a particular outcome is perceived as being 'fair'.\nWhat is procedural fairness?\n'Procedural fairness' means acting fairly in administrative decision making.  It relates to the fairness of the\nprocedure by which a decision is made and is also referred to as natural justice.\nThe concept of procedural fairness is critical to fair decision making. It recognises and addresses possible\npower imbalances, ensures individuals are treated with dignity and promotes public confidence in decision\nmaking.  Moreover, ensuring that the procedure by which a decision is made is fair makes it much more\nlikely that the ultimate decision will also be fair in a substantive sense.\nAs administrative decision-makers, the Boards and their delegates owe a duty to afford procedural fairness to\npeople affected by their decisions.  Whether something is 'procedurally fair' depends on the circumstances –\nthis is discussed further below.\nIn general, procedural fairness traditionally involves two requirements:\n- the fair hearing rule; and\n- the rule against bias.\nThe fair hearing rule requires a decision maker to afford a person an appropriate opportunity to be heard\nbefore making a decision which affects their interests.  The rule against bias ensures that a decision maker\ncan be objectively regarded as impartial and not having pre-judged a decision.\nThe term 'affected person' is used in this chapter to describe a person whose interests are or may be\naffected by a decision or proposed decision. This will normally be a practitioner who is the subject of\nregulatory action in respect of their registration status or as a result of a notification.\nPurpose of this chapter\nThis chapter will outline, in general terms, the requirements of procedural fairness, as well as provide\nexamples of how these concepts apply in the context of regulatory action taken u nder Part 8 of the National\nLaw.   The final portion of the chapter will discuss procedural fairness under the National Law in more detail.\n12.2 The fair hearing rule\nKEY POINTS\n- The fair hearing rule requires a decision maker to afford a person a reasonable opportunity to respond to\ninformation being considered before making a decision affecting their interests.\n- In practice, what the fair hearing rule requires will differ depending on the context and the circumstances\nsurrounding the decision to be made.  However, the key elements will remain the same.\nWhat is required by the fair hearing rule?\nThe fair hearing rule requires that, before a decision is made that can adversely affect a person's right,\ninterest or legitimate expectation, the decision-maker must:\n- give the person sufficient prior notice that a decision may be made;\n- inform the person of the information, particularly adverse information, on which the decision may be\nbased;\n- provide the person with the right, and reasonable opportunity, to make a submission in reply; and",

What is specifically required to\nensure procedural fairness may also vary between different decisions of the same kind, due to differences in\nthe circumstances of each specific case.\nThe nature of the decision being made can influence how much is required to be done in order to comply\nwith the fair hearing rule.  For example, the nature of the decision being made (along with other specific\ncircumstances in a particular case) can influence:\n- the format in which a person is permitted to provide any response (eg in writing, or by submissions in\nperson, or both);\n- whether a person is permitted to have a legal representative appear and speak on their behalf;\n- how much material is provided to a person in advance of their response being received; and\n- how long a person is given to prepare their response.\nSome decisions will require a more comprehensive process in order to ensure that the fair hearing rule has\nbeen complied with.  In general terms, the fair hearing rule may require additional, or more fulsome, steps to\nbe taken where:\n- the decision to be made is final, rather than of a preliminary or interim nature;\n- there are no or limited appeal rights available to the affected person after the decision has been\nmade;\n- the hearing will be held in public or the outcome of the decision will be published; or\n- the subject matter (such as allegations against an affected person, or the degree to which the\ndecision will affect the person's rights) is particularly serious.\nIn other circumstances, it may not be necessary or possible for the decision-maker to take as many steps to\ncomply with the fair hearing rule.  Examples of these circumstances include where the decision to be made is\nof an urgent nature or of an interim nature.\nEXAMPLE 1\nImmediate action under section 156 of the National Law\nCONTEXT\nIn the immediate action context, the decisions to be made by\nthe Board (or, more commonly, a committee of the Board) are\noften of an urgent nature, due to serious concerns having\nbeen raised about whether the practitioner constitutes a\nserious risk to the persons (or it is otherwise in the public\ninterest that immediate action be taken).",

This does not necessarily\nmean that the person must be provided with copies of all evidence or documents that the decision- maker will\nconsider in every case. For example, if providing a full copy of material would expose another person to risk,\nthe affected person may be provided with redacted material or a summary of the relevant material.\nThe right to make a submission in reply\nIn most circumstances, it will only be necessary to provide the affected person with an opportunity to make a\nwritten, rather than oral, submission.  An oral hearing is ordinarily only required where there are matters of\ncredit or truthfulness to be resolved, or where there are disputed factual matters or inconsistencies in\nevidence.  However the practitioner may be provided with the opportunity to make an oral submission if\nsought and such a request is reasonable in the circumstances.\nIf an oral hearing has been arranged, there is no absolute right for an affected person to be represented by a\nlawyer, agent or other person176.  Often, because of the seriousness of the matter and the complexity of the\nissues involved, procedural fairness will require that the affected person is permitted representation  and\ngenerally a person will be allowed to have a representative present if they want such assistance. Regardless\nof whether a person is represented at the hearing, an affected person is always entitled to take such advice\nfrom a legal representative as they consider necessary or appropriate.\nThe requirement to consider the submission of an affected person\nThe requirement to fairly consider submissions made or evidence led by a person merely means that the\ndecision-maker must take those matters and all other relevant material into account in making the decision.\nIt does not mean that the decision-maker is obliged to agree with those submissions, or prefer that evidence.\n12.3 The rule against bias\nKEY POINTS\n- The rule against bias requires a decision-maker to be objectively regarded as impartial and not having pre-\njudged a decision.\n- The law recognises two types of bias: actual bias and apprehended bias.\n- The surrounding context will be relevant to whether particular conduct or circumstances constitutes actual\nor apprehended bias.\nWhat is meant by the rule against bias?\nThe rationale for the rule against bias arises from two principles in the common law:\n- that decision making must be impartial; and\n- that impartial decision making and the absence of bias promote public confidence in the justice\nsystem.\nTypes of bias\nThe law recognises two types of bias:\n- actual bias, which is present when a decision-maker's mind, because of an interest in the outcome\nof a decision (such as a financial or family interest), actual hostility or prejudice towards or pre-\njudged position about an affected person, is so closed to persuasion by the affected person that\nrelevant arguments are ineffective; and\n- apprehended bias, which is present where a fair-minded, reasonably well informed lay177 observer\nmight reasonably apprehend that the decision-maker might not bring an impartial mind to the\nresolution of the question that the decision-maker is deciding.\nFindings of actual bias are rarely made in practice, as it is very difficult to prove that a decision-maker has, for\nsome reason, reached a fixed and final conclusion and is not open to persuasion or argument.  Further, in\nmany cases, decision-making bodies are not comprised of just one person but a number of different people",

This may mean that, for example, the decision- makers\nbelong to or are registered with an organisation which is a party in a proceeding.

    "text": "APPLICATION\nThe purpose of having a professional member sit on\nthe tribunal panel is partially to ensure that a\npractitioner's conduct is being assessed with the\nassistance and perspective of one of their\nprofessional peers.  While this may have the effect\nthat a matter concerning a practitioner is heard by at\nleast one person who is registered with the same\nboard that is a party to the proceeding, this does not\nconstitute apprehended bias in the circumstances (in\nfact, it is generally a legislative requirement).\nFor more information about the tribunal hearing process, see Chapter 8.\n12.4 Procedural fairness in decision making under the National Law\nAs administrative decision-makers, the Boards and their delegates owe duties to afford procedural fairness to\npeople affected by their decisions (usually, health practitioners registered under the National Law).\nAs illustrated above, what is required in order to ensure procedural fairness is context-dependent.  It is\npossible for procedural fairness requirements to differ between decisions of the same kind, having regard to\nthe circumstances of a particular case.\nDoes the National Law stipulate procedural fairness requirements?\nKEY POINTS\n- In many decision making processes under the National Law, specific procedures are required to be\nfollowed, which often have the effect of ensuring that procedural fairness has been provided.\n- However, the obligation for decision-makers to follow any relevant procedures under the National Law is\nseparate to the obligation to afford procedural fairness to an affected person.\nIn many processes governed by Part 8 of the National Law and indeed, in many other aspects of decision\nmaking under different parts of the National Law, specific procedures are required to be followed before a\ndecision is made.\nAn example of this are the show cause procedures required when taking immediate action or relevant action:\nthese procedures, when followed correctly, generally give effect to the fair hearing rule.\nThe procedures set out in the National Law must be (and are) followed in making decisions to which they\napply, and these procedures, when followed, generally ensure procedural fairness.  However:\n- following the procedures does not automatically mean that procedural fairness has been provided\n(though this will usually be the case, as the procedures have been designed for this purpose);\n- any failure by a Board or committee to follow the procedures does not necessarily mean that\nprocedural fairness has not been provided; and\n- where there are no specific procedures, procedural fairness must still be provided.\nIn summary, the obligation for decision makers to follow any relevant procedures under the National Law is\nseparate to the obligation to afford procedural fairness to an affected person.\nThe remainder of this chapter will outline the ways in which practitioners are afforded procedural fairness in\nprocedures under Part 8 of the National Law.  Further information about each procedure is provided\nelsewhere in the Regulatory Guide.",

    "text": "Regulatory Guide April 2021 103\nProcedural fairness in the Immediate Action process\nKEY POINTS\n- The National Law establishes a 'show cause' process which must be followed before immediate action is\ntaken.\n- Some aspects of this process are flexible, and what is required in order to ensure procedural fairness\ndepends on the circumstances of the particular case.\nThe immediate action process is outlined in Division 7 of Part 8 of the National Law, and is discussed in detail\nin Chapter 3.  Immediate action is interim action that a Board can take to restrict or suspend a practitioner's\nability to practise. A Board will do so if it reasonably believes that interim regulatory action is necessary to\nprotect the public from a serious risk, or is otherwise in the public interest.\nAs noted above, before taking immediate action, a Board (or relevant committee of the Board) i s required to:\n- give the practitioner notice of the proposed immediate action; and\n- invite the practitioner to make a submission to the Board, within the time stated in the notice. 178\nUpon receipt of the notice, a practitioner may choose to provide a submission or to make no submission. The\npractitioner may provide submissions in writing and/or orally to the Board.179  As the fair hearing rule rarely\nrequires that an affected person be provided with an oral hearing, this aspect of the National Law likely\nextends beyond the requirements of procedural fairness at common law (though the National Law is not\nprescriptive about the forum in which oral submissions are to be provided).\nThe National Law does not stipulate the time within which a practitioner must make a submission.  What\namount of time is procedurally fair will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.  In urgent\nsituations, the stated time in the notice from the relevant Board to the practitioner about the proposed\nimmediate action may be a matter of hours.  In the case of a long-standing investigation where there is not, or\nis unlikely to be, imminent danger to the health of patients and there has been extensive correspondence\nwith the practitioner, procedural fairness will likely require a longer time period to respond.\nIn addition to the urgency, the fact that an immediate action decision is of an interim nature (in that the\nimmediate action will only remain in place for a limited time) is also relevant to what is required by procedural\nfairness in the circumstances.\nProcedural fairness in the investigation process\nKEY POINTS\n- The National Law is not prescriptive about what is required to ensure that a practitioner is afforded\nprocedural fairness in the course of an investigation.\n- The fair hearing rule requires that practitioners are provided with the opportunity to respond to the\nallegations being investigated and any relevant, significant and credible evidence or material prior to any\nform of relevant action being taken.\nThe investigation process is outlined in Division 8 of Part 8 of the National Law, and is discussed in detail in\nChapter 5.\nThe National Law is not prescriptive about what is required to ensure that a practitioner is afforded\nprocedural fairness in the course of an investigation, although affected persons must be given notice of the\nnature of a notification received about them unless doing so would prejudice an investigation or place\nanother person at risk.180 Otherwise, it is open for an investigator to take a flexible approach, which may vary,\ndepending on the nature of the investigation.\nProcedural fairness does not necessarily require a practitioner to be provided with relevant material and an\nopportunity to make submissions during or at the conclusion of an investigation. That obligation arises if the\nBoard or panel (the decision maker) proposes to impose a disciplinary sanction.",

This is usually the\ncase where a different decision-maker, such as independent court or tribunal, considers the matter afresh\nand makes its own decision on the merits.  Provided that the fair hearing rule and the rule against bias are\nfollowed in the later hearing, any earlier breach of procedural fairness is unlikely to be material to (or capable\nof affecting) the later decision.",

AI development often occurs in highly controlled and\nidealised settings which can outpace the development of robust evidence in ‘real-world’\nclinical settings. It is essential to review available evidence, such as published literature,\nrequired medical device labelling information (including instructions for use) and information\nfrom the AI developer supporting intended use, accuracy, efficacy, and safety. In cases where\nsupporting evidence for the performance of AI tools is limited or absent, including non-TGA\nregulated AI tools, clinicians together with their patient must carefully and transparently weigh\nthe potential harms against the anticipated benefits prior to use in clinical settings. Refer to the\nCommission’s Introduction of new interventional procedures and clinical practice innovations\nfor further guidance.\nIf you are not satisfied with the evidence to support the accuracy, efficacy and safety of\nthe AI tool, you should re-consider its use in consultation with your organisation.\nEstablish AI transparency and informed consent procedures\nClinicians are responsible for ensuring that patients are informed about the use of AI in their\ncare, including its purpose, scope of use, and the associated benefits and risks. Be prepared\nto explain:\n- That you review outputs and remain responsible for final clinical documentation\nand decisions\n- Why the AI tool is being used in the delivery of care\n- Its benefits, limitations and potential risks\n- The processes in place for monitoring safety and performance of AI tools.\nThe broad and varied uses of AI make consent complex and there is no single approach.\nThe method of disclosure and type of consent required will normally be determined by your\norganisation and depend on the nature of the AI tool, the clinical and non-clinical concerns or\nissues including privacy, data handling and use, and where applicable, sharing with third\nparties. You should be:\n- Satisfied that appropriate and proportionate informed consent procedures and\ndocumentation are in place and adhered to; and contribute to continuous\nimprovement processes\n- Adopting your organisation’s approach for managing situations where a patient does not\nconsent to the use of AI in their care.\nUnderstand common limitations and risks\nMachine learning and generative AI tools are shaped by the data they are trained on, known\nas training data, and by their nature create information that may not be factual, sometimes\ncalled ‘hallucinations’.3 If underlying AI tool data and computational models lack diversity or is\nnot representative of the patient cohort, it can lead to biased outputs. Over time, these outputs\nmay also change. There are documented cases where AI tools have disadvantaged certain\npatient groups due to underrepresentation in the training data.

This\nguidance should be read in conjunction with the Commission’s AI Clinical Use Guide. Also\nreview the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) and the National\nBoards guidance and information from your professional association or college for\nexample The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.\nAI tools using machine learning (ML) have increasing use and can support clinical\ndecision-making.1 Examples include AI-based algorithms used in medical imaging systems\nto analyse mammograms to detect cancer and classify breast density and for abnormality\ndetection in chest radiographs.\nAlthough computer-aided medical image interpretation has been used for decades, there\nare key differences in contemporary AI tools:\n- They are trained and tested to detect specific findings within defined populations and\nclinical settings.\n- ML algorithms within AI tools may operate with limited transparency, making it difficult\nfor clinicians to understand how they produced specific predictions or classifications.\n- Are usually TGA approved as a medical device, including the ML algorithm.\nThe use of AI tools in medical imaging can have a direct impact on clinician decision-\nmaking and due diligence should be taken to consider appropriate use, consent, target\npopulation, known limitations such as bias, risks and benefits, ongoing monitoring\nand outcomes.\nBefore using AI for image interpretation\nReview the evidence\nAs most AI tools used in medical image interpretation require approval by the TGA, the\ndeveloper or your organisation should provide information about the AI tool’s Australian\nRegister of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) inclusion status, intended use and instructions for\nuse including risks and risk mitigations. Also carefully review and observe the identified\n‘intended user’ as stated in the instructions for use. Considerations for assessing AI in\nimage interpretation1 include:",

    "text": "2\nAn international code of ethics for nurses was first adopted by\nthe International Council of Nurses (ICN) in 1953. It has been\nrevised and reaffirmed at various times since, most recently\nwith this review and revision completed in 2021.\nPURPOSE OF THE CODE\nThe ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses is a statement of the eth ical\nvalues, responsibilities and professional accountabilities of\nnurses and nursing students 1 that defines and guides ethical\nnursing practice within the different roles nurses assume. It is\nnot a code of conduct but can serve as a framework for eth ical\nnursing practice and decision-making to meet professional\nstandards set by regulatory bodies.\nThe ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses  provides ethical guidance\nin relation to nurses’ roles, duties, responsibilities, behaviours,\nprofessional judgement and relationships with patients, other\npeople who are receiving nursing care or services, co-workers\nand allied professionals. The Code is foundational and to be\nbuilt upon in combination with the laws, regulations and profes-\nsional standards of countries that govern nursing practice. The\nvalues and obligations expressed in this Code apply to nurses\nin all settings, roles and domains of practice.\nPREAMBLE\nFrom the origins of organised nursing in the mid-1800s and\nrecognising nursing care is deeply rooted in the traditions\nand practices of equity and inclusion and in the appreciation\nof diversity, nurses have consistently recognised four funda -\nmental nursing responsibilities: to promote health, to prevent\nillness, to restore health, and to alleviate suffering and promote\na dignified death. The need for nursing is universal.\nInherent in nursing is a respect for human rights , including\ncultural rights, the right to life and choice, the right to dignity\nand to be treated with respect. Nursing care is respectful of\nand unrestricted by considerations of age, colour, culture, eth-\nnicity, disability or illness, gender, sexual orientation, nation-\nality, politics, language, race, religious or spiritual beliefs,\nlegal, economic or social status.\n1   The practice of the nursing student needs to be in line with the ICN\nCode of Ethics. Depending on the level of education, the responsibility\nfor the student nurse’s conduct is shared between the student\nand her/his supervisor.",

    "text": "3\nNurses are valued and respected for their contributions to\nimproving the health of individuals, families, communities and\npopulations locally, nationally and globally. They coordinate\nservices with those of other health care professionals and\nrelated groups. Nurses demonstrate values of the profession\nsuch as respect, justice, empathy, responsiveness, caring,\ncompassion, trustworthiness and integrity.\nTHE ICN CODE\nThe ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses has four principal elements\nthat provide a framework for ethical conduct: nurses and\npatients or other people requiring care or services, nurses and\npractice, nurses and the profession, and nurses and global\nhealth.\nAPPLYING THE ELEMENTS OF THE CODE\nThe charts that follow the description of each element of the\nCode are intended to assist nurses to translate the standards\ninto action. Note that these charts present examples of the\nmain tenets included in the elements of the Code and are not\nintended to be an exhaustive or complete list of concepts.\nThe ethical duties and values of nursing apply to all forms\nof nursing services and roles: clinicians, educators, students,\nresearchers, managers, policy makers and others. Professional\nassociations are also guided by these duties and values. A\ndiagram (p. 21) illustrates the relationship of the values and\nduties to the nursing profession.",

    "text": "4\nSUGGESTIONS FOR USE\nof the ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses\nThe ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses is a guide for action based\non social values and needs. It will have meaning only as a\nliving document if applied to the realities of nursing and health\ncare in all settings in which nursing care is delivered.\nTo achieve its purpose the Code must be understood, internalised\nand used by nurses in all aspects of their work. It must be available\nto students and nurses throughout their study and work lives.\nNurses can therefore:\n- Study the standards under each element of the Code.\n- Personally reflect on what each standard means.\nThink about ways to apply ethics to the personal domain\nof nursing practice, education, research, management,\nleadership or policy development.\n- Discuss the Code with co-workers and others.\n- Use a specific example from experience to identify ethical\ndilemmas and standards of conduct as outlined\nin the Code. Identify ways in which the Code guides\nin the resolution of dilemmas.\n- Work in groups to clarify ethical decision making\nand reach a consensus on standards of ethical conduct.\n- Collaborate with the National Nurses Association,\nco-workers, and others in the continuous application\nof ethical standards in nursing practice, education,\nmanagement, research and policy.\nDISSEMINATION\nof the ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses\nTo be effective the ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses  must be\nfamil iar to nurses. We encourage its dissemination to schools of\nnursing, nurses in their workplace, the nursing press and other\nmass media. The Code should also be disseminated to other\nhealth professions, the general public, consumer and policy-\nmaking groups, human rights organisations and employers of\nnurses. NNAs are encouraged to adopt this Code, translating it\ninto local language(s), or use it as a framework to support their\nown codes of nursing ethics.",

Note that ‘review body’ refers both to Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs)\nand to non-HREC review bodies.\nThe Preamble sets out the historical context of the National Statement. This is followed by a brief\nexplanation of its purpose, scope and limits. The document then has five sections, with multiple\nchapters in Sections 2 to 5.\n- Section 1: Values and principles of ethical conduct sets out values and principles that\napply to all human research. It is essential that researchers and review bodies consider\nthese values and principles and be satisfied that the research proposal addresses and\nreflects them.\n- Section 2: Themes in research ethics: risk and benefit, consent discusses the concept of risk\nin research and the role of participants’ consent — themes in all human research — and is\nagain essential for all users.\nChapter 2.1 will help researchers and reviewers to understand and describe the level\nof risk involved in the planned research, and how to minimise, justify and manage that risk,\nand (with reference to Chapter 5.1) what level of ethical review is suitable.\nChapters 2.2 and 2.3 will help to identify the information that needs to be disclosed\nto participants. It will help researchers to draft information for participants and plan the\nconsent process (or develop a proposal for waiver of consent). And it will help reviewers\nto assess the suitability of the proposed consent process.\nAll of Section 2 will help participants understand what information they are entitled\nto receive, and what their participation in research will characteristically involve.\n- Section 3: Ethical considerations in the design, development, review and conduct of\nresearch will help researchers and reviewers to identify ethical matters specific to the\nresearch methods proposed.\n- Section 4: Ethical considerations specific to participants will help researchers and\nreviewers to identify ethical matters relating to specific categories of research participants.\nParticipants in these categories will also find this Section valuable.\n- Section 5: Research governance and ethics review will help those involved in research\ngovernance to understand their responsibilities for research ethics and ethics review and\nmonitoring of human research, and provides criteria for their accountability. Chapter 5.2\nwill help researchers and reviewers to identify their responsibilities in relation to the ethics\nreview of research.",

    "text": "4\nNATIONAL STATEMENT ON ETHICAL CONDUCT IN HUMAN RESEARCH\nPREAMBLE\nPREAMBLE\nEthical background\nAll human interaction, including the interaction involved in human research, has ethical dimensions.\nHowever, ‘ethical conduct’ is more than simply doing the right thing. It involves acting in the right\nspirit, out of an abiding respect and concern for one’s fellow creatures. The National Statement\non ‘ethical conduct in human research’ is therefore oriented to something more fundamental than\nethical ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’ — namely, an ethos that should permeate the way those engaged in\nhuman research approach all that they do in their research.\nHuman research is research conducted with or about people, or their data or tissue. It has\ncontributed enormously to human good. Much human research carries little risk and in\nAustralia the vast majority of human research has been carried out in a safe and ethically\nresponsible manner. But human research can involve significant risks and it is possible for things\nto go wrong. Sometimes risks are realised despite the best of intentions and care in planning\nand practice. Sometimes they are realised because of technical error or ethical insensitivity,\nneglect or disregard. On rare occasions the practice of research has even involved the deliberate\nand appalling violation of human beings — notoriously, the Second World War experiments in\ndetention and concentration camps.\nThis range of possibilities can give rise to important and sometimes difficult ethical questions\nabout research participation. Two considerations give further weight to those questions.\nFirst, research participants may enter into a relationship with researchers whom they may not know\nbut need to trust. This trust adds to the ethical responsibility borne by those in whom it is placed.\nSecondly, many who contribute as participants in human research do so altruistically, for the\ncommon good, without thought of recompense for their time and effort. This underscores the\nimportance of protecting research participants.\nSince earliest times, human societies have pondered the nature of ethics and its requirements\nand have sought illumination on ethical questions in the writings of philosophers, novelists,\npoets and sages, in the teaching of religions, and in everyday individual thinking. Reflection on\nthe ethical dimensions of medical research, in particular, has a long history, reaching back to\nclassical Greece and beyond. Practitioners of human research in many other fields have also long\nreflected upon the ethical questions raised by what they do. There has, however, been increased\nattention to ethical reflection about human research since the Second World War. The judgment\nof the Nuremberg military tribunal included ten principles about permissible medical experiments,\nsince referred to as the Nuremberg Code. Discussion of these principles led the World Medical\nAssembly in 1964 to adopt what came to be known as the Helsinki Declaration, revised several\ntimes since then. The various international human rights instruments that have also emerged since\nthe Second World War emphasise the importance of protecting human beings in many spheres\nof community life. During this period, written ethical guidelines have also been generated in many\nareas of research practice as an expression of professional responsibility.\nBut what is the justification for ethical research guidelines as extensive as the National Statement,\nand for its wide-reaching practical authority?\nThe National Statement has been extended to address many issues not discussed in the\nprevious version, or discussed in less detail. This is in response to requests for clearer guidance\nfor those conducting research and those involved in its ethical review. At the same time,\nwithout compromising the protection of participants, the revised National Statement provides\nfor greater flexibility in the practice of ethical review, depending on the type and area of research\nand the degree of risk involved.",

There is,\ntherefore, a public responsibility for seeing that these interactions are ethically acceptable to the\nAustralian community. That responsibility is acknowledged and given effect in the wide-reaching\nauthority of the National Statement, which sets out national standards for the ethical design,\nreview and conduct of human research. Its content reflects the outcome of wide consultation\nwith Australian communities who participate in, design, conduct, fund, manage and publish\nhuman research.\nResearch governance\nThe National Statement should be seen in the broader context of overall governance of research.\nIt not only provides guidelines for researchers, Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs)\nand others conducting ethics review of research, but also emphasises institutions’ responsibilities\nfor the quality, safety and ethical acceptability of research that they sponsor or permit to be carried\nout under their auspices.\nResponsibility for the ethical design, review and conduct of human research is in fact exercised at\nmany levels, by: researchers (and where relevant their supervisors); HRECs and others conducting\nethics review of research; institutions that set up the processes of ethics review, and whose\nemployees, resources and facilities are involved in research; funding organizations; agencies that\nset standards; and governments. While the processes of ethics review are important in this field,\nindividual researchers and the institutions within which they work hold primary responsibility for\nseeing that their research is ethically acceptable.\nIn addition to the National Statement, the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research\n(the Code) has an essential role in promoting good research governance. The Code sets down\nthe broad principles of responsible and accountable research practice, and identifies the\nresponsibilities of institutions and researchers in areas such as data and record management,\npublication of findings, authorship, conflict of interest, supervision of students and research\ntrainees, and the handling of allegations of research misconduct.\nAuthors of the National Statement\nThe National Statement has been jointly developed by the National Health and Medical Research\nCouncil (NHMRC), the Australian Research Council (ARC) and Universities Australia (UA). This joint\nundertaking reflects a widely shared conviction that there is a need for ethics guidelines that are\ngenuinely applicable to all human research; and it gives expression to the shared responsibility for\nethically good research described above.\nThe National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 (NHMRC Act) establishes the NHMRC\nas a statutory body and sets out its functions, powers and obligations. Section 10(1) of the Act\nrequires the Chief Executive Officer to issue human research guidelines precisely as developed by\nthe Australian Health Ethics Committee (AHEC) and provided to the CEO by the Council. AHEC is\nestablished by the NHMRC Act as a Principal Committee of the NHMRC. All the guidelines in the\nNational Statement that are applicable to the conduct of medical research involving humans are\nissued by the NHMRC in fulfilment of this statutory obligation.\nThe Australian Research Council Act 2001 (ARC Act) establishes the ARC to provide the responsible\nMinister with advice and recommendations about research, including which research programs\nshould receive financial assistance. The functions of the ARC also include administering the\nregimes of financial assistance for research and providing for the funding of research programs.\nUniversities Australia (UA) is the peak body representing Australia’s 39 comprehensive universities\nin the public interest, both nationally and internationally. Its primary role is to advocate for\nregulatory, policy and fiscal settings conducive to a world-class university system.",

Fulfilment of\nthis purpose requires that participants be accorded the respect and protection that is due to them.\nIt also involves the fostering of research that is of benefit to the community.\nThe National Statement is therefore designed to clarify the responsibilities of:\n- institutions and researchers for the ethical design, conduct and dissemination of results\nof human research; and\n- review bodies in the ethics review of research.\nThe National Statement will help them to meet their responsibilities: to identify issues of ethics that\narise in the design, review and conduct of human research, to deliberate about those ethical issues,\nand to justify decisions about them.\nUse of the National Statement\nThe National Statement must be used to inform the design, ethics review and conduct of human\nresearch that is funded by, or takes place under the auspices of, any of the bodies that have\ndeveloped the National Statement (NHMRC, ARC, UA).\nIn addition, the National Statement sets national standards for use by any individual, institution\nor organisation conducting human research. This includes human research undertaken\nby governments, industry, private individuals, organisations, or networks of organisations.\nWhat is research?\nThere is no generally agreed definition of research; however, it is widely understood to include\nat least investigation undertaken to gain knowledge and understanding or to train researchers.\nThe British Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) definition of research is somewhat wider:\n‘Research’… includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to\nthe public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images,\nperformances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved\ninsights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new\nor substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design\nand construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components\nand processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the\ndevelopment of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching\nmaterials that do not embody original research.\nTo enable comparative assessment of academic activity, this definition sought to include the\nwidest range of creative and experimental activities. Many items in the definition are uncontentious,\nbut there may be disagreement about some — for example, ‘the invention and generation of new…\nimages, performances, artefacts…where these lead to new or substantially improved insights’ —\nsince this could count poetry, painting and performing arts as research.1\n1 Higher Education Funding Council for England, Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for Wales, & Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland (2005) RAE 2008: Guidance to Panels,\np.28.

(See Ethical\nConsiderations in Quality Assurance and Evaluation Activities)\nWhat is human research?\nHuman research is conducted with or about people, or their data or tissue. Human participation\nin research is therefore to be understood broadly, to include the involvement of human\nbeings through:\n- taking part in surveys, interviews or focus groups;\n- undergoing psychological, physiological or medical testing or treatment;\n- being observed by researchers;\n- researchers having access to their personal documents or other materials;\n- the collection and use of their body organs, tissues or fluids (eg skin, blood, urine,\nsaliva, hair, bones, tumour and other biopsy specimens) or their exhaled breath;\n- access to their information (in individually identifiable, re-identifiable or non-identifiable\nform) as part of an existing published or unpublished source or database.\nThe term ‘participants’ is therefore used very broadly in the National Statement to include\nthose who may not even know they are the subjects of research; for example, where the need\nfor their consent for the use of their tissue or data has been waived by a Human Research\nEthics Committee (HREC).\nIn addition, the conduct of human research often has an impact on the lives of others who are\nnot participants. When this impact is reasonably foreseeable, it may raise ethical questions\nfor researchers and for those ethically reviewing research.\nWhen is ethical review needed?\nInstitutions are responsible for establishing procedures for the ethical review of human research.\nThat review can be undertaken at various levels, according to the degree of risk involved in\nthe research (see Chapter 2.1: Risk and benefit and Chapter 5.1: Governance responsibilities\nof institutions). Research with a greater than low level of risk (as defined in Chapter 2.1) must be\nreviewed by an HREC. Research involving no more than low risk may be reviewed under other\nprocesses described in 5.1.10 to 5.1.14. Institutions may also determine that some human research\nis exempt from ethics review (see 5.1.15 and 5.1.18).\nA judgement that a human research proposal meets the requirements of the National Statement\nand is ethically acceptable must be made before research can begin and before full funding for\nthe proposal is released.\nEthics and law in human research\nHuman research is governed by Australian law that establishes rights for participants and\nimposes general and specific responsibilities on researchers and institutions. Australian common\nlaw obligations arise from the relationships between institutions, researchers and participants.\nContractual arrangements may impose obligations on research funders and institutions.",

The values set out in this section — respect for human beings, research\nmerit and integrity, justice, and beneficence — help to shape that relationship as one of trust,\nmutual responsibility and ethical equality. For this reason, the National Statement speaks of\nresearch ‘participants’ rather than ‘subjects’.\nWhile these values have a long history, they are not the only values that could inform a document\nof this kind. Others include altruism, contributing to societal or community goals, and respect\nfor cultural diversity, along with the values that inform Ethical conduct in research with Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander Peoples and communities: Guidelines for researchers and stakeholders.\nHowever, the values of respect, research merit and integrity, justice, and beneficence have become\nprominent in the ethics of human research in the past six decades, and they provide a substantial\nand flexible framework for principles to guide the design, review and conduct of such research.\nThe National Statement is organised around these values, and the principles set out in 1.1 to 1.13\ngive them practical expression.\nAmong these values, respect is central. It involves recognising that each human being has value\nin himself or herself, and that this value must inform all interaction between people. Such respect\nincludes recognising the value of human autonomy — the capacity to determine one’s own life\nand make one’s own decisions. But respect goes further than this. It also involves providing for the\nprotection of those with diminished or no autonomy, as well as empowering them where possible\nand protecting and helping people wherever it would be wrong not to do so.\nReference to these values throughout the National Statement serves as a constant reminder that,\nat all stages, human research requires ethical reflection that is informed by them. The order in which\nthey are considered reflects the order in which ethical considerations commonly arise in human research.\nResearch merit and integrity are discussed first. Unless proposed research has merit, and the\nresearchers who are to carry out the research have integrity, the involvement of human participants\nin the research cannot be ethically justifiable.\nAt a profound level, justice involves a regard for the human sameness that each person shares\nwith every other. Human beings have a deep need to be treated in accordance with such justice,\nwhich includes distributive justice and procedural justice. In the research context, distributive\njustice will be expressed in the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of research, and\nprocedural justice in ‘fair treatment’ in the recruitment of participants and the review of research.\nWhile benefit to humankind is an important result of research, it also matters that benefits of\nresearch are achieved through just means, are distributed fairly, and involve no unjust burdens.\nResearchers exercise beneficence in several ways: in assessing and taking account of the risks of\nharm and the potential benefits of research to participants and to the wider community; in being\nsensitive to the welfare and interests of people involved in their research; and in reflecting on the\nsocial and cultural implications of their work.\nRespect for human beings is the common thread through all the discussions of ethical values.\nTurning to it as the final value is a reminder that it draws together all of the ethical deliberation\nthat has preceded it.\nThe design, review and conduct of research must reflect each of these values.",

This decision may require consultation between\nresearchers, participants, the relevant ethical review body, and the institution. The review\nbody must be notified promptly of such suspension, and of any decisions following it\n(see 5.5.7 to 5.5.10).\nRespect\n1.10 Respect for human beings is a recognition of their intrinsic value. In human research,\nthis recognition includes abiding by the values of research merit and integrity, justice\nand beneficence. Respect also requires having due regard for the welfare, beliefs,\nperceptions, customs and cultural heritage, both individual and collective, of those\ninvolved in research.\n1.11 Researchers and their institutions should respect the privacy, confidentiality and cultural\nsensitivities of the participants and, where relevant, of their communities. Any specific\nagreements made with the participants or the community should be fulfilled.\n1.12 Respect for human beings involves giving due scope, throughout the research process,\nto the capacity of human beings to make their own decisions.\n1.13 Where participants are unable to make their own decisions or have diminished capacity\nto do so, respect for them involves empowering them where possible and providing for\ntheir protection as necessary.\nApplication of these values and principles\nResearch, like everyday life, often generates ethical dilemmas in which it may be impossible to find\nagreement on what is right or wrong. In such circumstances, it is important that all those involved in\nresearch and its review bring a heightened ethical awareness to their thinking and decision-making.\nThe National Statement is intended to contribute to the development of such awareness.\nThe National Statement does not exhaust the ethical discussion of human research. There are,\nfor example, many other specialised ethical guidelines and codes of practice for specific areas\nof research. Where these are consistent with the National Statement, they should be used to\nsupplement it when this is necessary for the ethical review of a research proposal.\nThese ethical guidelines are not simply a set of rules. Their application should not be mechanical.\nIt always requires, from each individual, deliberation on the values and principles, exercise of\njudgement, and an appreciation of context.",

For this reason, the two themes are brought together in this section,\nbefore discussion in the following sections of ethical considerations specific to the elements of\nresearch and ethical considerations specific to participants.\nChapter 2.1 Risk and benefit\nIntroduction\nApplication of the values in Section 1, in particular the value of beneficence, requires that the\nrisk and benefit of research be assessed and that any risks are effectively minimised, mitigated\nor managed. While this chapter provides guidance on the assessment of risk, such assessment\ninevitably involves the exercise of judgment.\nA risk is a potential for harm or discomfort (discussed below). It involves:\n- the likelihood that a harm or discomfort will occur, and\n- the severity or magnitude of the harm or discomfort, including their consequences.\nWhile discussion of the risk of harm or discomfort in this chapter applies to risk to an individual\nresearch participant, it can also apply to groups or communities as well as to non-participants\nsuch as family members.2 Risk can be associated with the conduct of research or the proposed\noutcomes of the research.3\nRisk in research exists on a continuum with the risk profile of an individual research project falling\nsomewhere along this continuum. In order to determine the proportionate level of review and\noversight for each project, the use of risk categories is useful. These categories are described\nin Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Risk profiles of research\nLower risk Higher risk\n(Individual, group, community, societal or global)\nMinimal Low Greater than low High\nNo risk of harm or\ndiscomfort; potential\nfor minor burden\nor inconvenience*\nNo risk of harm;\nrisk of discomfort\n(+/- foreseeable\nburden)\nRisk of harm\n(+/- foreseeable\nburden)\nRisk of\nsignificant harm\n(+/- foreseeable\nburden)\n*Burden and inconvenience are discussed below\nRequirements for the ethics review of lower risk research and the criteria for granting an exemption from\nethics review are set out in 5.1.12 to 5.1.14 and 5.1.17.\n2 Assessing and managing risks of research to researchers and other research personnel is an important consideration,\nbut is the responsibility of the research team, supervisors and the institution with oversight of the research.\n3 Risk of harm that may arise from research misconduct or fraud, and harms to members of research teams from other forms\nof misconduct is addressed in the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research  and in institutional policy.",

Accordingly, research in which the risk for\nparticipants or others is greater than discomfort is not low risk research. Research in this category\nis considered higher risk research and carries risk of harm. Higher risk research requires review by\nan HREC.\nInstitutions may choose to differentiate between levels of lower risk or between levels of higher risk\nfor review or monitoring purposes. They may choose to develop review processes to accommodate\nthese differentiations in level of risk, taking care to respect the principle of proportionate review\nwhen establishing any such review processes.\nRisk of harm or discomfort\nWhile no list of harms can be exhaustive, one helpful classification identifies the following types\nof potential harms in or from research4:\n- physical harm: including injury, illness, pain or death;\n- psychological harm: including feelings of worthlessness, distress, guilt, anger, fear\nor anxiety related, for example, to disclosure of sensitive information, an experience\nof re-traumatisation, or learning about a genetic possibility of developing an\nuntreatable disease;\n- devaluation of personal worth: including being humiliated, manipulated\nor in other ways treated disrespectfully or unjustly;\n- cultural harm: including misunderstanding, misrepresenting or misappropriating\ncultural beliefs, customs or practices;\n- social harm: including damage to social networks or relationships with others,\ndiscrimination in access to benefits, services, employment or insurance, social\nstigmatisation, and unauthorised disclosure of personal information;\n- economic harm: including the imposition of direct or indirect costs on participants;\n- legal harm: including discovery and prosecution of criminal conduct.\nAny of these types of harm can be experienced individually or collectively.\nDiscomfort is considered less serious than harm. It can involve physical or psychological impacts,\nfor example, minor side-effects of medication, discomfort related to non-invasive examinations\nor tests (such as measuring blood pressure), and mild anxiety associated with an interview.\nHowever, where a person’s reactions might exceed discomfort and become distress, this should\nbe viewed as the potential for harm.\nSome participants may be at higher risk of harm or discomfort arising from research. The increased\nrisk of harm or discomfort can express itself in different ways at different times and to different\ndegrees and can arise from:\n(a)  the nature, design or other contextual factors of the research, such as the setting in which\nthe research will be conducted, the social or political implications of doing the research\nand cultural factors or some combination of these factors;\n(b)  specific attributes or characteristics of individual participants or of groups to which they\nbelong and/or\n(c)  interaction between (a) and (b).\nHarm and discomfort to non-participants may also be relevant. Examples of risks to non-participants\nfrom research include the risk of distress for a participant’s family member identified as having\n4 Adapted from National Bioethics Advisory Commission, Ethical and Policy Issues in Research Involving Human Participants,\nBethesda, 2001 pp 71-72.",

Some social research may carry\nwider social or economic risks; for example, research in a small community into attitudes to specific\nsubpopulations may lead to unfair discrimination or have effects on social cohesion, property\nvalues or business investment. Research into the impact of public health policy on community\nwell-being or into social determinants of health may also carry a risk of harm to participants\nor their communities.\nBurden and inconvenience\nIn addition to risk of harm or discomfort, participation in research can also impose burdens\nor inconvenience on those involved in research. Neither burden nor inconvenience should\nbe considered a type of harm or discomfort and therefore should not be viewed as a risk.\nNevertheless, in designing, reviewing and conducting research, researchers and ethics review\nbodies should consider the impact of any burdens or inconvenience on participants and balance\nthem against the potential benefits of the research.\nExamples of burden and inconvenience may include the time that will need to be given up to\nparticipate in the research, filling in forms and costs related to travel.\nAssessing Risk\nThe risks of a research project must be identified and assessed in order to minimise, mitigate or\nmanage them. Researchers, institutions and ethics review bodies are all engaged in the assessment\nprocess. In assessing the risks of a research project, researchers, institutions and ethics review\nbodies should only consider the risks that may result from the research, as distinguished from the\nrisks participants would be exposed to if they were not participating in the research (see also 3.1.6).\nAssessment of risk informs the determination of the appropriate level of review for a research\nproject by the institution and reviewers’ judgments about whether risks are justified by\npotential benefits. These judgments should be based on the available evidence. The evidence\nmay be quantitative, qualitative or both. In any case, the process of assessing risk needs to be\ntransparent and defensible.\nStrategies to minimise or mitigate the risk of research may be required and subjected to assessment\nby reviewers of research. These should include strategies to ensure that participants are not unfairly\nexcluded from research because of the risk to them of participating in the research (see 1.4).\nFor research using large collections of data or information, researchers and reviewers should review\nChapter 3.1, Element 4. They should also review and consider applying best practice frameworks\nfor assessing the risks of accessing and using such data and the corresponding safeguards.\nFor those assessing the likelihood and severity or magnitude of potential harms in research, the choices,\nexperience, perceptions, values and vulnerabilities of individual participants or different groups of\nparticipants will be relevant.\nDo the benefits justify the risks?\nResearch is ethically acceptable only when its potential benefits justify any risks involved in the research.\nBenefits of research may include, for example, gains in knowledge, insight and understanding,\nimproved social welfare and individual wellbeing, gains in skill or expertise for individual\nresearchers, teams or institutions, or evidence-based responses to public health emergencies.\nSome research may offer direct benefits to the research participants, their families, or particular\ngroup/s with whom they identify. Where this is the case, participants may be willing to take on\na higher degree of risk than they might otherwise take on. For example, people with serious illness\nmay be willing to accept research risks (such as treatment side-effects) that would be unacceptable",

Those conducting ethics review of research should take such\nwillingness into account in deciding whether the potential benefits of the research justify the\nrisks involved.\nFor ethics review bodies, there can be a profound tension between the obligations to both provide\nparticipants with the scope to accept risk and see that research is conducted in a way that is of\npossible benefit and minimises harm.\nIn describing and assessing the potential benefits and assessing the risks of research, researchers\nand reviewers should exercise care not to overemphasise either.\nGuidelines\n2.1.1 A judgment that research is ethically acceptable requires:\n(a)  identifying the risks and burdens potentially arising from the research, if any, and which\nparticipants or others might be at risk of harm or experience discomfort or burden;\n(b)  assessing the likelihood and severity or magnitude of the risks;\n(c)  considering and describing actions or strategies that could effectively minimise,\nmitigate and/or manage each risk, including modifications to the research design;\n(d)  identifying the potential benefits and to whom any benefits are likely to accrue;\n(e)  weighing the risks and burdens against the potential benefits and determining that\nany risks and burdens are justified by the potential benefits.\n2.1.2 In determining the potential benefits and the existence, likelihood and severity or\nmagnitude of risks, researchers and those reviewing the research should base their\nassessments on the available evidence and should consider whether to seek advice\nfrom others who have experience with similar methodology, population and/or\nresearch domain.\n2.1.3 To weigh the benefits and risks, researchers and reviewers must assess the research\naims and the various methods by which they can be achieved in order to minimise or\nmitigate any risks.\n2.1.4 The greater the risks in any research for which ethical approval is given, the more\ncertain reviewers must be both that the risks will be managed as effectively as possible\nand that the participants clearly understand the risks they are assuming.\n2.1.5 In considering whether the potential benefits of the research justify the risks and\nburdens involved, those reviewing research should take into account any willingness by\nparticipant populations to assume greater risks or burdens because of their perception\nof the potential benefits to them, their families, or groups or communities to which\nthey belong.",

This requirement has the\nfollowing conditions: consent should be a voluntary choice, and should be based on sufficient\ninformation and adequate understanding of both the proposed research and the implications of\nparticipation in it.\nWhat is needed to satisfy these conditions depends on the nature of the project, and may be\naffected by the requirements of the codes, laws, ethics and cultural sensitivities of the community\nin which the research is to be conducted.\nVariations of these conditions may be ethically justified for some research. Respect for human\nbeings must, however, always be shown in any alternative arrangements for deciding whether\npotential participants are to enter the research.\nIt should be noted that a person’s consent to participate in research may not be sufficient to justify\nhis or her participation.\nThis chapter provides guidelines on the requirement for consent. Chapter 2.3: Qualifying or waiving\nconditions for consent then discusses and provides guidelines on conditions under which the\nrequirement may be qualified or waived.\nGuidelines\n2.2.1 The guiding principle for researchers is that a person’s decision to participate in research\nis to be voluntary, and based on sufficient information and adequate understanding of\nboth the proposed research and the implications of participation in it. For qualifications\nof this principle, see Chapter 2.3: Qualifying or waiving conditions for consent.\n2.2.2  Participation that is voluntary and based on sufficient information requires an adequate\nunderstanding of the purpose, methods, demands, risks and potential benefits of\nthe research.\n2.2.3  This information must be presented in ways suitable to each participant (see 5.2.17).\n2.2.4 The process of communicating information to participants and seeking their consent\nshould not be merely a matter of satisfying a formal requirement. The aim is mutual\nunderstanding between researchers and participants. This aim requires an opportunity\nfor participants to ask questions and to discuss the information and their decision with\nothers if they wish.\n2.2.5  Consent may be expressed orally, in writing or by some other means (for example,\nreturn of a survey, or conduct implying consent), depending on:\n(a) the nature, complexity and level of risk of the research; and\n(b) the participant’s personal and cultural circumstances.\n2.2.6 Information on the following matters should also be communicated to participants.\nExcept where the information in specific sub-paragraphs below is also deemed\nnecessary for a person’s voluntary decision to participate, it should be kept distinct\nfrom the information described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2:",

Here as always,\na person should be included as a participant only if his or her consent is voluntary.\nReimbursing participants\n2.2.10 It is generally appropriate to reimburse the costs to participants of taking part in research,\nincluding costs such as travel, accommodation and parking. Sometimes participants may\nalso be paid for time involved. However, payment that is disproportionate to the time\ninvolved, or any other inducement that is likely to encourage participants to take risks,\nis ethically unacceptable.\n2.2.11 Decisions about payment or reimbursement in kind, whether to participants or their\ncommunity, should take into account the customs and practices of the community in\nwhich the research is to be conducted.",

Researchers should\nbear in mind that the capacity to consent may fluctuate, and even without that capacity\npeople may have some understanding of the research and the benefits and burdens of\ntheir participation. For implications of these factors, see Chapter 4.2: Children and young\npeople, Chapter 4.4: People highly dependent on medical care who may be unable\nto give consent, and Chapter 4.5: People with a cognitive impairment, an intellectual\ndisability, or a mental illness.\n2.2.13 Within some communities, decisions about participation in research may involve not\nonly individuals but also properly interested parties such as formally constituted bodies,\ninstitutions, families or community elders. Researchers need to engage with all properly\ninterested parties in planning the research.\nConsent to future use of data and tissue in research\n2.2.14 Consent may be:\n(a) ‘specific’: limited to the specific project under consideration;\n(b)  ‘extended’: given for the use of data or tissue in future research projects that are:\n(i) an extension of, or closely related to, the original project; or\n(ii)  in the same general area of research (for example, genealogical, ethnographical,\nepidemiological, or chronic illness research);\n(c) ‘unspecified’: given for the use of data or tissue in any future research.\nThe necessarily limited information and understanding about research for which extended\nor unspecified consent is given can still be sufficient and adequate for the purpose of\nconsent (see 2.2.2).\n2.2.15 Extended or unspecified consent may sometimes need to include permission to enter\nthe original data or tissue into a databank or tissuebank (see 3.2.9).\n2.2.16 When unspecified consent is sought, its terms and wide-ranging implications should be\nclearly explained to potential participants. When such consent is given, its terms should\nbe clearly recorded.\n2.2.17 Subsequent reliance, in a research proposal, on existing unspecified consent should describe\nthe terms of that unspecified consent.\n2.2.18 Data or tissue additional to those covered by the original extended or unspecified\nconsent will sometimes be needed for research. Consent for access to such additional\ndata or tissue must be sought from potential participants unless the need for this\nconsent is waived by an ethical review body.\nDeclining to consent and withdrawing consent\n2.2.19 People who elect not to participate in a research project need not give any reason for\ntheir decision. Researchers should do what they can to see that people who decline to\nparticipate will suffer no disadvantage as a result of their decision.\n2.2.20  Participants are entitled to withdraw from the research at any stage. Before consenting\nto involvement in the research, participants should be informed about any consequences\nof such withdrawal.",

This is because in some human research (for example, in the study of behaviour),\nthe aims of the research cannot be achieved if those aims and/or the research method are fully\ndisclosed to participants.\nResearch involving limited disclosure covers a spectrum, from simply not fully disclosing or\ndescribing the aims or methods of observational research in public contexts, all the way to actively\nconcealing information and planning deception of participants. Examples along the spectrum\ninclude: observation in public spaces of everyday behaviour; covert observation, for example of\nthe hand-washing behaviour of hospital employees; undisclosed role-playing by a researcher to\ninvestigate participants’ responses; telling participants the aim of the research is one thing when\nit is in fact quite different.\nDepending upon the circumstances of an individual project it may be justifiable to employ an\nopt-out approach or a waiver of the requirement for consent, rather than seeking explicit consent.\nA single research project may involve discrete elements or participant groups where different\nrecruitment approaches can be used. For example, a project may involve some elements or\nparticipant groups where explicit consent must be sought and other elements where an opt-out\napproach may be considered or where a waiver of the consent requirement may be applied.\nThe opt-out approach is a method used in the recruitment of participants into research where\ninformation is provided to the potential participant regarding the research and their involvement\nand where their participation is presumed unless they take action to decline to participate.\nWhile an opt-out approach makes it possible for people to make an informed choice about\ntheir participation, this choice can only be made if participants receive and read the information\nprovided, and they understand that they are able to act on this information in order to decline\nto participate.\nImportantly, the opt-out approach is unlikely to constitute consent when applying commonwealth\nprivacy legislation to the handling of sensitive information, including health information. Therefore,\nwhere it is impracticable to obtain an individual’s explicit consent to the use of their information\nand the purpose of the research cannot be served by using non-identifiable information,\nresearchers must comply with the Guidelines under Section 95 of the Privacy Act 1988 (s95\nguidelines) or the Guidelines approved under Section 95A of the Privacy Act 1988 (s95A guidelines)\n(as applicable) to ensure that their handling of personal information does not breach the Privacy\nAct 1988. Where researchers need approval to use an opt-out approach for research to which\nthe s95 or 95A guidelines apply, only an HREC may grant this approval. Other review bodies may\napprove an opt-out approach for other research.\nThe Australian Privacy Principles Guidelines contain further information about consent and the handling\nof personal information.\nWhen neither explicit consent nor an opt-out approach are appropriate, the requirement for consent\nmay sometimes be justifiably waived. When an HREC or, where appropriate, another review body\ngrants a waiver of consent for research conducted prospectively or retrospectively, research\nparticipants will characteristically not know that they, or perhaps their tissue or data, are involved\nin the research.",

This material should be read in conjunction\nwith the Preamble (Purpose, scope and limits) and Section 2: Themes in research ethics: risk and\nbenefit, consent.\nThis section aims to be compatible with and relevant for many different ways of doing\nhuman research. It requires those who conduct and approve human research to consider:\n- how the research question/theme is identified or developed\n- the alignment between the research aims and methods\n- how the researchers and the participants will engage with one another\n- how the research data or information are to be collected, stored, and used\n- how the results or outcomes will be communicated, and\n- what will happen to the data and information after the project is completed.\nThe guidance in this section identifies common ethical issues that arise in the various phases\nof research. It is up to each researcher and HREC to apply the guidance to each project, taking\naccount of the four principles of research merit and integrity, justice, beneficence and respect.\nThis guidance facilitates consideration of the risks and benefits of the research and the level of\nethical oversight required.\nThe guidance in Chapter 3.1 is broadly applicable to all fields of research, including those types\nof research for which additional specific guidance is provided in Chapters 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.\nChapter 3.1 is designed around seven elements that are common to most — if not all — forms of research.\nThe chapter starts with considering the ethical issues associated with developing the research scope,\naims, themes, questions and methods, and ends with ethical considerations that pertain after the\nproject comes to an end.\nThe elements are:\nElement 1 — Research Scope, Aims, Themes, Questions and Methods\nElement 2 — Recruitment\nElement 3 — Consent\nElement 4 — Collection, Use and Management of Data and Information\nElement 5 — Communication of Research Findings or Results to Participants\nElement 6 — Dissemination of Research Outputs and Outcomes\nElement 7 — After the Project\nResearchers who are designing a research project should read all of Chapter 3.1, noting which\nparts of the guidance are relevant for their project. In addition, if research involves biospecimens,\ngenomics or xenotransplantation, they should also consult the specific chapters on these topics.",

For example, innovative clinical practice occurs on a spectrum from\nminor changes at the border of established practice that pose little change in risk to patient\nsafety to novel interventions that should only be introduced as part of an ethically approved\nresearch protocol.\nWhether an innovative clinical practice should be undertaken only as clinical research may depend\non the extent to which the procedure departs from established practice. Importantly, even if the\nintroduction of an innovative practice falls within existing clinical guidance, its implementation\nand the associated collection of data for monitoring and reporting may require notification to\nthe institution/s where the practice is taking place.\nWhen it is not clear whether an innovation should be implemented only as research, it may be\nnecessary to seek advice from a Human Research Ethics Committee or other institutional review\nprocess on the review required for the new intervention.\nResearchers planning to do any type of research involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\npeoples must consult and follow the advice in the most contemporary versions of Ethical conduct\nin research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and communities: Guidelines for\nresearchers and stakeholders and Keeping research on track II as well as the AIATSIS Code of\nEthics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research (2020) and A Guide to Applying the\nAIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research (2020). produced by\nthe Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. These guidelines embody\nthe best standards of ethical research and human rights and seek to ensure that research with and\nabout Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples follows a process of meaningful engagement\nand reciprocity between the researcher and the individuals and/or communities involved in\nthe research.\nResearchers should also consult the most contemporary version of NHMRC’s Statement on\nConsumer and Community Participation in Health and Medical Research.",

These principles apply at all stages of a research project from inception to\npost-completion.\nHuman research can involve a wide range of methods and practices: it can be qualitative,\nquantitative or mixed; interventional, experimental or observational in nature; and involve various\ndegrees of collaboration between researchers and participants. Each research project is shaped by\nthe field to which the research question relates, the research question itself, the desired outcome,\nand the context in which it is conducted.\nEffective research ethics review incorporates appropriate expertise related to relevant methods\nor areas of practice. Reviewers should be aware of expectations and apply requirements that\nare relevant to the areas of practice or methods used in projects that they review. This requires\nbecoming familiar with methods or areas of practice that are unfamiliar or novel.\nA range of relationships between participants and researchers may develop as a result of the\nduration and nature of the research interaction. Some methodological approaches require\ncareful boundaries to be maintained between researchers and research participants. In contrast,\nother research fields require data collection methods that involve the development of close\npersonal relationships with participants, or degrees of collaboration that blur the lines between\nresearcher and participant (e.g. co-researchers in action research).\nResearchers may have an impact on research participants and vice versa and this impact may\ncompromise a researcher’s role or professionalism. If this is anticipated and/or occurs, it may\nbecome necessary to modify those relationships, or to modify or discontinue the research.\nAdditionally, a researcher may have other professional skills (for example, counseling or clinical\ncare) that become relevant to the relationship with a participant. In this event, it is important to\nconsider whether it is ethically acceptable to exercise those skills or, alternatively, to refer that\nparticipant to another professional.\nThe guidance provided in Chapters 4.3 and 5.4 is relevant to the researcher’s duty to inform\nparticipants that they are acting in a professional role other than the research role.\nResearch may involve risks to participants. To the extent that it is appropriate, the development\nof clear protocols for managing any distress that might be experienced by participants during\nthe process of data collection or conduct of research procedures is an important component\nof planning research. Predicting what topics are likely to lead to distress and how to manage this\ndistress will not always be easy. Access to sufficient training to help researchers and reviewers\nin making such predictions is valuable. Refer to Chapter 2.1 for a further discussion about the\nidentification and handling of risk in research.\nThis chapter discusses the manner in which the core principles of the National Statement should be\nreflected in the elements of research project design. The chapter should be considered as a whole;\nhowever, the order in which these elements are discussed does not imply a hierarchy or a sequence,\nor that all of these elements will have equal relevance in every design. The elements are:\n- Element 1: Research Scope, Aims, Themes, Questions and Methods\n- Element 2: Recruitment\n- Element 3: Consent\n- Element 4: Collection, Use and Management of Data and Information\n- Element 5: Communication of Research Findings or Results to Participants",

Such designs can be a valid and\npowerful way to collect qualitative information and to inform practice.\n3.1.4 For interventional research conducted in the context of health care or public health,\nresearchers should additionally determine and state:\n(a)  whether the project involves the systematic investigation of the safety, efficacy and/or\neffectiveness of an intervention;\n(b)  if the research involves exposure to an intervention for which the safety or efficacy,\nor both, is not well understood:\n(i)  whether it is likely or possible that the intervention will be of therapeutic\nbenefit and\n(ii)  whether there is a realistic possibility that the intervention being studied\nwill be at least as beneficial overall as standard treatment, taking into account\neffectiveness, burden, costs and risks;\n(c)  where patient care is combined with intent to contribute to knowledge, that any risks\nof participation should be justified by potential benefits to which the participants\nattach significance. The prospect of benefit from research participation should\nnot be exaggerated, either to justify to the reviewing body a higher risk than that\ninvolved in the participant’s current treatment or to persuade a participant to accept\nthat higher risk;\n(d)  whether the intervention or other research procedures are without likely benefit to\nparticipants.

The exclusion of some groups may amount to unfair\ndiscrimination, and/or exclude individuals and groups from the potential benefits of\nresearch. Researchers should consider the degree to which including/excluding groups\nmay limit (or compromise) the value of the results of a project, with consequent impact\non the merit of the project.\n3.1.15 Researchers and reviewers should consider the degree to which potential participant\npopulations might be over-researched or may require special consideration or\nprotection and the degree to which the flow of benefits to that population (or to\nindividual participants) justify the burdens. Equally, people should not be denied the\nopportunity to exercise self-determination or obtain the potential benefits of research\nsolely because they are a member of a population that might be over-researched or\nmay require special consideration or protection, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander peoples.\n3.1.16 The recruitment strategy must be respectful of potential participants and their culture,\ntraditions and beliefs and facilitate their voluntary participation.\n3.1.17 In developing and implementing their recruitment strategy, researchers should consider:\n(a) the potential for coercion/exploitation;\n(b)  any risks to participants related to recruitment (see Chapter 2.1) and how the pattern\nof recruitment might be structured to mitigate any risks to participants;\n(c)  any privacy matters relating to the recruitment of participants;\n(d)  the potential impact of existing relationships on recruitment (including, but not\nlimited to, hierarchical relationships that may generate an unequal or dependent\nrelationship, such as teacher and student, manager and employee, supervisor and\nteam member or treating health care professional and patient);\n(e)  the potential impact of participation on existing relationships;\n(f)  whether participants will be recruited by co-researchers or other members of the\nproject team who are unfamiliar with the guidance provided by the National\nStatement; and\n(g)  whether the research requires community engagement or agreements related to the\nresearch to be in place prior to individual recruitment.\n3.1.18 Researchers should describe and justify their approach to potential participants\n(i.e. how do they find out about the possibility of participating, or not, in the research).\nThe level of detail that is required by reviewers should be proportional to the\nforeseeable risks and appropriate to the methodology selected.\n3.1.19 For many research projects, researchers should provide reviewers with proposed\nrecruitment materials (e.g. notices, flyers, advertisements, and social media posts) prior\nto use, including those materials that are developed subsequent to the initial review\nof the research proposal. However, for some research designs or where recruitment\nmaterial needs to be ad lib, adapted or tailored to the context (such as some social\nmedia, radio or other oral communication) a description of the strategy and broad\nmessages is sufficient.\n3.1.20 Researchers and reviewers should consider the potential impact of the recruitment\nstrategy upon the consent process (e.g. the degree to which the recruitment strategy\nmight undermine the voluntary nature of the consent of individual potential participants).",

This is especially important with respect to research that involves more than\na low risk of harm.\nElement 3: Consent\nWell-designed consent strategies are appropriately tailored to the potential participants, the research\ndesign, the topic and the context. Obtaining consent in a manner that shows respect for participants\nfacilitates valid consent. This may involve obtaining consent as part of an ongoing process.\nObtaining consent may be a component of broader processes of consultation, engagement and\nnegotiation, such as in the context of research involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples\n(see Chapter 4.7).\nThe guidance in Element 3 should be considered in the context of the guidance provided in\nChapters 2.2 and 2.3. These chapters provide essential guidance on the selection and framing\nof a consent strategy or alternatives to consent, such as an opt-out approach or waiver of the\nrequirement for consent.\nThe guidance in Chapters 2.2, 2.3, and this Element should be considered in applying the guidance\non consent included in Chapters 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.\nKey questions include:\n- What strategy(ies) for obtaining consent, or alternatives to consent are appropriate\nfor the specific project?\n- Does the nature of the project design, the participants or the context necessitate the use\nof more than one strategy?\n- Do the proposed strategy(ies) satisfy the relevant requirements of Chapters 2.2 and 2.3?\n- Are there any project-specific matters that warrant specific attention (e.g. whether the\nresearch could generate results of significance to participants, whether the data will\nbe added to an open or mediated access repository or whether the data or materials will\nbe used for any other purpose)?\n3.1.22 Researchers should ensure that any proposed consent strategy:\n(a)  provides all of the required information and assurances as set out in Chapters 2.2\nand 2.3, as relevant to the proposed research; and\n(b)  uses tools and language that are appropriate, respectful and relevant to the\nresearch design, objectives, potential participants and context, including relevant\ncultural sensibilities.\n3.1.23 Researchers and reviewers should recognise that research involving multiple methods\nor different groups of potential participants may require more than one consent\nstrategy or may require consent to be revisited and renegotiated over time.\n3.1.24 There is a range of strategies that may be appropriate for obtaining consent.\nWhile these may include the provision of a written information and consent document,\nother strategies may be more appropriate. It is not a requirement of the National\nStatement that participants’ consent must, routinely, be witnessed.\n3.1.25 An information and consent document or other consent strategy should be appropriate\nto the needs of the participants and proportional to the project’s risks and ethical\nsensitivity.

    "text": "33\nSECTION 3\nNATIONAL STATEMENT ON ETHICAL CONDUCT IN HUMAN RESEARCH\nWhat is data and what is information?\nThe terms ‘data’ and ‘information’ are often used interchangeably. Data can refer to raw data,\ncleaned data, transformed data, summary data and metadata (data about data). It can also\nrefer to research outputs and outcomes. Likewise, information takes many different forms.\nWhere information is in a form that can identify individuals, protecting their privacy becomes\na consideration.\nFor the purposes of the National Statement, ‘data’ is intended to refer to bits of information\nin their raw form, whereas ‘information’ generally refers to data that have been interpreted,\nanalysed or contextualised.\nData and information may include, but not be limited to:\n- what people say in interviews, focus groups, questionnaires/surveys, personal histories\nand biographies;\n- images, audio recordings and other audio-visual materials;\n- records generated for administrative purposes (e.g. billing, service provision) or as\nrequired by legislation (e.g. disease notification);\n- digital information generated directly by the population through their use of mobile devices\nand the internet;\n- physical specimens or artefacts;\n- information generated by analysis of existing personal information (from clinical, organizational,\nsocial, observational or other sources);\n- observations;\n- results from experimental testing and investigations; and\n- information derived from human biospecimens such as blood, bone, muscle and urine.\nIdentifiability of information5\nResearchers and reviewers must consider the identifiability of data and information in order to\nassess the risk of harm or discomfort to research participants or others who may be at risk.\nThe risks related to identifiability of data and information in research are greatest where the identity\nof a specific individual can reasonably be ascertained by reference to an identifier or a combination\nof identifiers (examples of identifiers include the individual’s name, image, date of birth or address,\nattribute or group affiliation). Risk may also arise where identifiers have been removed from the\ndata or information and replaced by a code, but where it remains possible to re-identify a specific\nindividual (by, for example, unlocking the code or linking to other data sets that contain identifiers).\nDue to technological advances, risks may arise in relation to data and/or information that has never\nbeen labelled with individual identifiers or from which identifiers have been permanently removed.\nThe identifiability of information is a characteristic that exists on a continuum. This continuum\nis affected by contextual factors, such as who has access to the information and other potentially\nrelated information, and by technical factors that have the potential to convert information\nthat has been collected, used or stored in a form that is intended to protect the anonymity\nof individuals into information that can identify individuals. Additionally, contextual and technical\nfactors can have a compound effect and can increase the likelihood of re-identifiability and the\nrisk of negative consequences from this in ways that are difficult to fully anticipate and that may\nincrease over time.\n5 The National Statement does not use the terms ‘identifiable’, ‘potentially identifiable’, ‘re- identifiable’, ‘non-identifiable’\nor ‘de-identified’ as descriptive categories for data or information due to ambiguities in their meanings. Re-identification\nand de-identification are best understood as processes that change the character of information and are only used\nwith this meaning.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.1: THE ELEMENTS OF RESEARCH",

Therefore, it is important for researchers and reviewers to focus on the risk\nof harm to affected individuals if their identity is ascertained and the effort that would be required\nto achieve this at each stage of a research project.\nFactors that should be taken into consideration when determining the degree of identifiability\nof information and when evaluating the associated risks include the type and quantity of\nthe information, any other information held by the individual who receives the information and\nthe capacity (skills and technology) available to the individual who receives it. Identifiability of\ninformation is also conditioned by contextual factors, such as whether only the person/s who\ncollected the information could use it to identify (an) individual/s, or whether those to whom\nit is disclosed or with whom it is shared for research purposes could also use it for this purpose.\nIdentifiability may also reflect features of the project such as the nature of the participant cohort:\nfor example, whether it includes high-profile individuals or members of small communities versus\nlarger populations.\nData and information that is contained in data sets, such as those held in government databases\nand by social media organisations, may be used (in sum or in part) to identify individuals.\nThis potential is due to the impact of predictive analytics, machine learning, increased commercial\naccessibility, proliferation of data sets, data breaches or degradation of privacy protections and\nother developments on access to and use of data and information. In this increasingly complex\nenvironment, researchers are encouraged to consult guidance promulgated by expert bodies such\nas the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and its state and territory equivalents,\nthe Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian National Data Service in addition to the\nNational Statement.\n3.1.39 The removal of personal identifiers may or may not be ethically required. Some research\nprojects may legitimately require the retention of personal identifiers, for example,\nto link information or data from a number of different sources or to return results to\nparticipants. In addition, some research populations (e.g. academics, activists and some\npublic figures) are amongst those who may prefer to be identified in the collection, use,\nand reporting of research data. Where participants choose to be identified, researchers\nand participants should collaboratively determine and agree upon whether all research\ndata or information collected from them will be identified, or only certain components\nof the collected data or information.\n3.1.40 Researchers should adopt methods to reduce the risk of identification during collection,\nanalysis and storage of data and information. Methods to reduce identifiability and the\nconsequent risks may include:\n(a) minimising the number of variables collected for each individual;\n(b) separation and separate storage of identifiers and content information; and\n(c)  separating the roles of those responsible for management of identifiers and those\nresponsible for analysing content.\n3.1.41 In any publications, researchers should ensure that the identity of participants cannot\nbe reasonably ascertained from the data or information that they use or report, unless\nthey have agreed to be identified. This may require minimising, obscuring, or changing\nidentifiers, either in the collection process or when presenting and publishing the\nresearch results.\n3.1.42 Where research involves linkage of data sets with the consent of participants,\nresearchers should advise participants that use of data or information that could be\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.1: THE ELEMENTS OF RESEARCH",

They should\nalso be given information about the security measures that will be adopted, for example\nthe removal of identifiers once linkage is completed.\nData management\n3.1.43 When multiple researchers are collaborating on collection, storage and/or analysis of\ndata or information, they should agree to the arrangements for custodianship, storage,\nretention and destruction of those materials, as well as to rights of access, rights to\nanalyse/use and re-use the data or information and the right to produce research\noutputs based upon them. Researchers should consider whether any intellectual\nproperty will be generated by the project and agree on the ownership of any\nintellectual property created. Agreements on such arrangements and ownership need\nnot necessarily be in the form of a contractual document, but should facilitate a clear\nresolution of these issues.\n3.1.44 For all research, researchers should develop a data management plan that addresses\ntheir intentions related to generation, collection, access, use, analysis, disclosure,\nstorage, retention, disposal, sharing and re-use of data and information, the risks\nassociated with these activities and any strategies for minimising those risks. The plan\nshould be developed as early as possible in the research process and should include,\nbut not be limited to, details regarding:\n(a)  physical, network, system security and any other technological security measures;\n(b) policies and procedures;\n(c) contractual and licensing arrangements and confidentiality agreements;\n(d) training for members of the project team and others, as appropriate;\n(e) the form in which the data or information will be stored;\n(f)  the purposes for which the data or information will be used and/or disclosed;\n(g)  the conditions under which access to the data or information may be granted to\nothers; and\n(h)  what information from the data management plan, if any, needs to be communicated\nto potential participants.\nResearchers should also clarify whether they will seek:\n(i)  extended or unspecified consent for future research (see 2.2.14 to 2.2.16); or\n(j)  permission from a review body to waive the requirement for consent (see 2.3.9 and 2.3.10).\n3.1.45 The security arrangements specified in the data management plan should be\nproportional to the risks of the research project and the sensitivity of the information.\n3.1.46 Researchers must comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements that\npertain to the data or information collected, used or disclosed as well as the conditions\nof the consent provided by participants.\n3.1.47 In relevant research, particularly that which involves the use of materials of biological\norigin, records should be preserved for long enough to enable participants to be traced\nin the event that evidence emerges of late or long-term health-related effects, taking\ninto account the conditions of consent that apply.\n3.1.48 Data, information and biospecimens used in research should be disposed of in a manner\nthat is safe and secure, consistent with the consent obtained and any legal requirements\nand appropriate to the design of the research.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.1: THE ELEMENTS OF RESEARCH",

Where a researcher believes there are valid reasons for not making data or\ninformation accessible, this must be justified.\nSecondary use of data or information\nResearch may involve access to and use of data or information that was originally generated or\ncollected for previous research or for non-research purposes, including routinely collected data\nor information. This is commonly called ‘secondary use of data or information’. The main ethical\nissue arising from this use is the scope of consent provided or, alternatively, the impracticability\nof obtaining consent.\nAdministrative data or information is data or information routinely collected during the delivery\nof a service e.g. by a government department or private service provider and may involve\ncollections of data or information from large numbers of people or whole populations. It is usually\nimpractical to obtain consent from individuals for secondary use of this data or information.\nIn these circumstances, respect for participants can be demonstrated in other ways, including,\nbut not limited to, community consultation, ensuring that the research results are translated into\nimprovements in services and practices, acknowledging the source of the data or information\nin publications and/or publishing the research results in a location and language suitable for\nthe general community. In particular, using data or information without consent may undermine\npublic trust in the confidentiality of their information.\nPrivacy concerns arise when the proposed access to or use of the data or information does not\nmatch the expectations of the individuals from whom this data or information was obtained or\nto whom it relates. These issues are especially complex in the context of the access to or use of\ninformation relating to individuals that is available on the internet, including social media posts,\ntweets, self-generated ‘lifelogging’ data emitted from mobile phones and other ‘smart’ appliances\nand data or information generated through applications and devices related to personal pursuits,\nsuch as fitness activity, gambling, dating and web-based gaming.\nData or information available on the internet can range from information that is fully in the public\ndomain (such as books, newspapers and journal articles), to information that is public, but where\nindividuals who have made it public may consider it to be private, to information that is fully\nprivate in character. The guiding principle for researchers is that, although data or information\nmay be publicly available, this does not automatically mean that the individuals with whom this\ndata or information is associated have necessarily granted permission for its use in research.\nTherefore, use of such information will need to be considered in the context of the need for consent\nor the waiver of the requirement for consent by a reviewing body and the risks associated with the\nuse of this information.\n3.1.50 For research involving the secondary use of data or information, researchers should\nmake study designs publically available, including information about:\n(a)  the form in which the data or information will be stored (i.e. whether it can identify\nindividuals); and\n(b)  the purposes for which the data or information will be used.\n3.1.51 Unless a waiver of the requirement for consent is obtained, any research access to or\nuse of publicly available data or information must be in accordance with the consent\nobtained from the person to whom the data or information relates.\n3.1.52 Researchers should understand the context in which data or information was collected\nor disclosed, including the existence of any relationship of confidence or, if available on\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.1: THE ELEMENTS OF RESEARCH",

This includes avoiding the use or disclosure\nof information that was obtained unethically or illegally.\n3.1.53 Researchers should take account of any terms and conditions applicable to social media\nplatforms when using data or information from these sources or platforms and other\nweb-based communities that do not permit the removal of the name of the author of\na post or any changes to the wording of a post.\nSharing of data or information\nWhile data or information may be collected, aggregated and stored for an initial purpose or activity,\nit is common for researchers to ‘bank’ their data or information for possible use in future research\nprojects or to otherwise share it with other researchers. It is also increasingly common for funding\nagencies to require the sharing of research data either via open access arrangements or via forms\nof mediated access controlled by licenses.\nTo this end, data or information may be deposited in an open or mediated access repository or data\nwarehouse, similar to an archive or library, and aggregated over time. Archived data or information\ncan then be made available for later analysis, unless access is constrained by restrictions imposed\nby the depositor/s, the original data custodian/s or the ethics review body.\n3.1.54 All data collections should have an identified custodian to enable access by researchers\nor participants to the data while maintaining it in a protected form. The custodian of the\ndata may be the individual researcher or agency who collected the information, or an\nintermediary that manages data coming from a number of sources.\n3.1.55 When planning to share data or information with other researchers or to establish or add\nthem to a databank, researchers must develop data management plans in accordance\nwith the guidance provided in 3.1.45. This plan should enable the sharing of data and\ninformation and propose appropriate conditions on the sharing of data and information.\n3.1.56 Researchers must make data custodians aware of the data management plans for\nbanking or sharing of the data or information, and, in particular, of any confidentiality\nagreements or other conditions on the identifiability or re-use of the data or information.\n3.1.57 Any sharing of data or information between research collaborators and research sites\nmust be secure and proportional to the risks associated with, and the ethical sensitivity\nof the information.\n3.1.58 In any proposals to share or disclose research data or information, researchers should\ndistinguish between disclosure to specific third parties, sharing with other researchers\nand disclosure to the public and clarify whether the sharing or disclosure of data\nor information is subject to participant consent, other voluntary agreements or\nmandatory requirements.\n3.1.59 Researchers should be aware of expectations and policies regarding the sharing or\nre-use of participant data or information in any form and should consider the value of\nthe data or information for future research. At the time of initial consent, participants\nshould be informed of these expectations and given appropriate options, including the\npotential to provide extended or unspecified consent (see 2.2.14 to 2.2.16). If consent\nto future use was not obtained at the time of collection, then reviewers considering the\nproposed re-use of this data or information in further research may consider a waiver\nof the requirement for consent or whether it is appropriate to seek additional consent\nfor the sharing or re-use of the data or information. Whether there is an ongoing\nrelationship with the participants and the burden on the participants of re-contact\nshould be considered in this decision.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.1: THE ELEMENTS OF RESEARCH",

Some research (e.g. analysis of human biospecimens)\ncan generate findings or results of significance to the health of individual participants, and,\npotentially, their relatives and other family members.\nProviding research findings or results to participants can be a benefit, but it can also be a source\nof risk (e.g. psychological, social, legal). The approach taken to communicating findings and results\nshould reflect principles of good science and adhere to the ethical principles of justice, respect\nand beneficence discussed in Section 1, including consideration of the values and preferences\nof traditional custodians, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\nCommunicating findings or results may be required or optional, appropriate or inappropriate, and/or\nintentional or unintentional depending on the nature of the research and other circumstances.",

It does not include non-human biological material such as\nmicro-organisms that live on or in a person.\nResearch involving human biospecimens often involves special ethical consideration because of:\n- the way that human biospecimens are obtained;\n- the information that may be derived from human biospecimens and the implications of\nthat information for the individual donor, their relatives and their community; and\n- the significance that may be attached to the human biospecimens by individual donors\nand/or communities.\nChapter 3.2 should be read in conjunction with Chapter 3.1 and other parts of the National Statement.\nResearchers and institutions must also meet any relevant legislative requirements that relate to the\ncollection, retention, use and disposal of human biospecimens, including the general prohibition on\ntrade in human tissue.\nSpecific considerations for human embryos, gametes and fetal tissue\nSpecific requirements for research involving fetal tissue are detailed in Chapter 4.1: Women who are\npregnant and the human fetus.\nResearch involving human embryos and gametes, including the derivation of human embryonic\nstem cell lines, is separately governed by the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002 (Cth)\nand the Ethical guidelines on the use of assisted reproductive technology in clinical practice and\nresearch (ART guidelines), issued by the NHMRC. Research involving the derivation of embryonic\nstem cell lines or other products from a human embryo must be considered by a Human Research\nEthics Committee (HREC) as part of a licence application to the Embryo Research Licensing\nCommittee (see Part C of the ART guidelines). The legislation and ART guidelines do not regulate\nthe use of these products after they have been derived.\nOnce human biospecimens have been derived from human embryos, gametes or fetuses,\nthe requirements of this chapter apply for any subsequent use in research.\nConscientious Objection\nThose who conscientiously object to being involved in conducting research using human\nbiospecimens derived from human embryos, gametes, fetuses or embryonic or fetal tissue\nshould not be obligated to participate, nor should they be put at a disadvantage because of\ntheir objection.\nElement 1: Research Scope, Aims, Themes, Questions and Methods\nEthical considerations related to laboratory based research involving human biospecimens vary\naccording to whether the biospecimens are being collected prospectively for the research or\nwhether the biospecimens to be used in the research are stored biospecimens that have been\npreviously collected for research or non-research purposes.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.2: HUMAN BIOSPECIMENS IN LABORATORY BASED RESEARCH",

It applies irrespective of the nature\nof the source material for the research, such as data or biological materials such as germline/germ\ncells or somatic cells.\nGenomic research is characterised by the original intention of the investigation and the potential\nhereditary and/or future health implications, if any, of the information that is collected or generated\nby the investigations. Genomic research is rapidly evolving and is not constrained by current\nmethods or techniques for obtaining the information; however, a common element of genomic\nresearch is the sequencing of data or its use.\nGenomic information can be predictive, unchanging, sensitive and familial. Genomic information\nhas the unique character of being both specific to an individual and specific to relatives of that\nindividual and, in some cases, of significance to human population groups such as groups that\ndefine themselves via their ancestral lineages.\nResearch results and information collected for genomic research may be significant for relatives\nof research participants. Relatives and other family members, such as partners and spouses,\nmay have an interest in the participants’ genomic material, or in information the research generates,\nbecause testing that material or acquiring that information may create new options for life\ndecisions, including those with the potential to improve their health or the health of their offspring.\nHowever, some family members may prefer not to be given such information, or even not to know\nof its existence.\nGenomic research can reveal information about predispositions to disease. Although people\nwith such a predisposition may not develop the disease, the information may have implications\nfor their access to employment and education and to benefits or services, including financial\nservices such as banking, insurance and superannuation. Genomic information can sometimes be\nmisused to stigmatise people or to discriminate against them unfairly. The information may also\nhave similar implications for close relatives. In addition, genomic research can reveal information\nabout previously unknown or misattributed paternity or maternity or familial relationship.\nGenomic research is frequently considered to be greater than low risk, especially in the context of\nresearch involving Indigenous peoples. For this reason, relevant on-going community consultation\nand active agreement on the part of communities and traditional owners is an essential component\nof the planning and conduct of this research.\nThis chapter is relevant to different types of genomic research (e.g. family studies, clinical research,\npopulation health research, health service research). Some research that falls within the broad\ndescription of genomic research does not involve information that is relevant to the future health\nof the individual participant and does not generate sensitivities for the individual, or his or her\nfamily or community. An example of this research is a population survey of preferences regarding\ndisclosure of genomic information where identifiers related to survey results are not disclosed.\nAs a general principle, research including genomics will require review by an HREC; however, if no\ninformation that can identify an individual is used and no linkage of data is planned, the research\nmay be determined to carry lower risk.\nIn genomic investigations, there may be a strong relationship between the research and clinical\ncontexts such that there may be clinical implications of research results or findings. Nevertheless,\ndifferences between results that are associated with research and results that are associated with\nclinical investigations should be clear, especially when the researcher is also a clinician and where\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.3: GENOMIC RESEARCH",

Where appropriate, researchers should refer to clinical practice guidelines\nsuch as the NHMRC’s Principles for the translation of ‘omics’–based tests from discovery to health\ncare and applicable legislation.\nChapter 3.3 should be read in conjunction with Chapter 3.1 and other parts of the National Statement.\nGuidelines\nElement 1: Research Scope, Aims, Themes, Questions and Methods\n3.3.1 Genomic research that uses sequenced information should be designed with attention\nto what information is necessary to achieve the aims of the research and to ensure that\nethical issues that arise from activity outside the intended scope of the research are\nminimised by, for example, developing a list of genes that are excluded from analysis.\n3.3.2 Genomic research should be designed to minimise the potential for misunderstanding and\nmisuse of genomic information by those who may wish to use it for unrelated purposes.\n3.3.3 Methods used in genomic research are not a static set, but are constantly evolving and,\nas they are developed and applied, may require ethical consideration on an ongoing basis.\nTherefore, the ethical principles and guidance in this chapter should be considered with\nreference to the new technologies as they are developed and applied.\nElement 2: Recruitment\n3.3.4 In addition to participants in genomic research identified as index cases (probands),\nrelatives of these individuals who provide information or biospecimens for genomic\nresearch become participants in the research in their own right. Therefore, researchers\nshould be aware of the possibility of the involvement of relatives by virtue of association\nwith a participant or other family member who has been recruited.\n3.3.5 HRECs must consider the rationale for and review the information to be used in recruiting\nfamily members of a participant.\n3.3.6 Where a potential research participant is not already known to the research team,\nit may be ethically preferable for the participant (rather than the researcher) to make\nthe initial contact with a family member for purposes of recruitment into research.\n3.3.7 Researchers should respect differences between and within families regarding the\nwillingness to communicate health information, the relative importance of privacy\nversus sharing of health information and other matters that may reflect cultural values\n(whether shared within the family or not).\n3.3.8 Where researchers propose to generate or collect genomic information from individuals\nwho are chosen because of their membership of a particular community, they should\nconsult with appropriate community representatives.\n3.3.9 The recruitment process should avoid disclosure of genomic information to a potential\nresearch participant as an inadvertent consequence of that process.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.3: GENOMIC RESEARCH",

The potential return of findings and\nresults of genomic research is covered in 3.3.26 to 3.3.35, below.\n3.3.18 Researchers should recognise and account for the potentially predictive and sensitive\nnature of genomic information.\n3.3.19 Researchers should be sensitive to the contextual factors that determine the identifiability\nof genomic information, in particular the impact of the rarity of a genetic disorder or\nmutation on whether individuals or families could be identified.\n3.3.20 For the purposes of a specific research project, the identification of individuals or family\nmembers can be considered impracticable if:\n(a)  there is no plan in the research proposal to link or match the information in such a\nway as to permit re-identification; and\n(b)  storage of biospecimens and project information is secure.\n3.3.21 If inclusion of information in databases is a necessary component of the research or if\ninformation is to be shared for other research, efforts should be made to minimise the\npotential for re-identification.\n3.3.22 Researchers receiving genomic information should not undertake nor permit attempts\nto re-identify the material or information or otherwise reduce the protection of the\nprivacy of the participants.\n3.3.23 Information generated or collected through genomic research should not be disclosed\nby researchers for uses unrelated to research; however, statutory or contractual\nduties may require participants to disclose the results of genetic tests or analysis to\nthird parties (for example, insurance companies, employers, financial and educational\ninstitutions), particularly where results provide information about health prospects.\nParticipants should be advised of these duties.\n3.3.24 Researchers may share genomic data or information provided that:\n(a)  sharing information is consistent with the consent that has been obtained for the\nresearch project or for clinical purposes; or\n(b)  an HREC has judged that the conditions for waiver of the requirement for consent\nhave been met (see 2.3.9 to 2.3.10); and\n(c)  the HREC has approved the transfer in principle, subject to any transfer agreement\nthat has been established for this purpose.\n3.3.25 Subject to the requirements of good research practice, genomic information and related\nbiospecimens should be stored or disposed of in accordance with the project-specific\nconsent provided or the governance policies of the relevant biobank.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.3: GENOMIC RESEARCH",

Researchers should\nconsider how these results will be provided to participants, how the process of\nreturning results will be managed and the risks of the return of individual research\nresults and overall research results.\n3.3.27 Return of findings and results relating to an individual participant depends on the\ncontextual relevance of the findings; some genomic research findings must be returned,\nsome findings may be returned and some findings should not be returned.\n3.3.28 While participants may have a strong interest in their own information, researchers are\nnot expected to return raw genomic data to participants.\n3.3.29 Once there is sufficient evidence and agreement that a finding or result is clinically\nsignificant, participants should be advised that research results or findings that may\nbe returned will first need to be confirmed according to applicable guidelines, e.g. at a\nNational Association of Testing Authorities (NATA)-accredited laboratory.\n3.3.30 When designing the research project and in considering whether to return findings\nto participants, researchers should refer to the Decision tree for the management of\nfindings in genomic research and health care for the principles/framework and then\nrefer to the guidance in the section Guidance for the Development and Evaluation of an\nEthically Defensible Plan for the Potential Return of Findings and Individual Results from\nGenomic Research that follows for developing an ethically defensible plan.\n3.3.31 Any plan to return individual research results should include linkage with a clinical\nservice and access to genetic counselling. The plan should specify any expertise\nto which the project team might require access.\n3.3.32 The return of results or findings of significance for the health of the participant or\nrelative is the responsibility of the appropriate clinical service or, where such a service is\nnot available, the participant’s clinician in consultation with the research team.\n3.3.33 Where a result or finding may be of relevance to one or more relatives, it is the remit\nof the appropriate clinical service or the participant’s clinician to discuss with the\nparticipant the appropriateness of communicating these results or findings to relatives.\n3.3.34 Over time there may be a substantive change in the understanding of the significance\nof the research results or findings. For the duration of the research project, researchers\nhave a responsibility to provide the research cohort with the opportunity for each\nparticipant to re-consider their decision related to receiving results or findings\n(see 3.3.53–3.3.55).\n3.3.35 In all other cases, any obligation to further analyse or interpret genomic data related to\nparticipant information ceases at the end of the project.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.3: GENOMIC RESEARCH",

In contrast, xenotransplants are living cells that can perform the same functions as\nthe organ, tissue or cells that they replace.\nThis chapter provides guidance for the ethical review and conduct of animal-to-human\nxenotransplantation research, hereafter referred to as xenotransplantation research.\nResearchers should seek advice from an HREC if they are unsure if their proposed research\nis covered by this chapter.\nChapter 3.4 should be read in conjunction with Chapter 3.1 and other parts of the National Statement.\nIn addition to the ethical considerations identified in Chapter 3.1 that are applicable to all research,\nthere are ethical considerations that are particularly relevant to xenotransplantation research.\nThese include:\n- the potential risk of disease transmission from animals to humans (xenozoonosis),\nincluding the risk of novel xenozoonoses;\n- the risk of the transmission of a xenozoonosis from the participant to their close contacts\nor other non-participants;\n- the need to balance the interests and safety of close contacts and other non-participants\nwith the interests of the participant;\n- the requirement for long-term or lifelong monitoring for safety. Monitoring may include\nthe participant and, potentially, their close contacts; and\n- limitations on the participant’s ability to withdraw consent. This may be due to the\ninability to remove the animal material or withdraw from long-term monitoring.\nHRECs must adopt a cautious approach when assessing the ethical acceptability of\nxenotransplantation research. Xenotransplantation research will only be ethically acceptable if the\npotential benefits justify the risks. HRECs responsible for approving xenotransplantation research\nmust consider the extent to which risks are unknown in the context of public safety and whether\nthe proposed research should proceed in view of potential unknown risks. An assessment of the\nrisks and benefits associated with xenotransplantation research may be particularly complex due to:\n- the potential risk not just to the individual, but also to close contacts and other non-participants;\n- the potential for catastrophic harm if an adverse event, such as xenozoonosis, were to\neventuate; and\n- unknown risks.\nSECTION 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONDUCT OF RESEARCH\nCHAPTER 3.4: ANIMAL-TO-HUMAN XENOTRANSPLANTATION",

The care and use of animals in\nxenotransplantation research must comply with the requirements of the Australian code for the\ncare and use of animals for scientific purposes and relevant state and territory legislation, and also\napplies to animal materials imported for use in xenotransplantation research.

The definition of ‘close\ncontacts’ may vary depending on the specific research and identified risks. Close\ncontacts may include the participant’s immediate family, close friends, work colleagues,\nor any person who is in intimate or frequent contact with the participant or the\nxenotransplantation material.\n3.4.3 If there are options that pose less risk or greater benefit to the participant, the HREC\nmust be satisfied that the research is ethically justified.\n3.4.4 When assessing risk to the participant, close contacts and other non-participants,\nresearchers and HRECs should consider:\n(a)  the type of material intended for transplantation, including whether the material will\nbe encapsulated in synthetic, animal or human material;\n(b)  the measures in place to minimise the potential for xenozoonoses. These measures\nmay include the use of specific pathogen-free herds or genetically modified animals;\n(c)  the anticipated level and duration of immunosuppression required for the participant;\n(d)  the likelihood of psychological and/or social harm to the participant;\n(e)  current clinical and/or theoretical evidence, including evidence of xenozoonoses and\nthe likely disease types, associated severity, infectious potential and likely mode of\ntransmission; and\n(f)  alternative treatment options available, including other clinical trials, which may pose\ngreater benefit to the participant or less risk to the participant, close contacts and other\nnon-participants.\n3.4.5 An ethically defensible plan for the management of risks related to xenotransplantation\nresearch must be developed for consideration by an HREC.

Section 5 describes the processes\nthat institutions may use to provide that approval. Those processes include ethics review by\nHuman Research Ethics Committees (HRECs) or other ethics review bodies, according to the\nrisks of the research (see Chapter 2.1 and Chapter 5.1).\nEthics review by an HREC is required for any research that involves greater than low risk. It is also\nrequired for research discussed in the following chapters of this section: Chapter 4.1: Women who\nare pregnant and the human fetus, Chapter 4.4: People highly dependent on medical care who may\nbe unable to give consent, Chapter 4.5: People with a cognitive impairment, an intellectual disability,\nor a mental illness, Chapter 4.6: People who may be involved in illegal activities, Chapter 4.7:\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and Chapter 4.8: People in other countries.\nAs stated at the end of Section 1, the National Statement does not exhaust the ethical discussion\nof human research. Even a single research field covers a multitude of different situations about\nwhich the National Statement will not always offer specific guidance, or to which its application\nmay be uncertain. Where other guidelines and codes of practice in particular research fields are\nconsistent with the National Statement, researchers and members of ethical review bodies should\ndraw on them when necessary to clarify researchers’ ethical obligations in particular contexts.\nChapter 4.1  Women who are pregnant and\nthe human fetus\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides guidelines for the ethical conduct of research involving women who\nare pregnant, the human fetus ex utero, and human fetal tissue after the separation of the fetus\nfrom the woman. The chapter is arranged to reflect the following established categories of\nsuch research:\n- research on the woman who is pregnant and the fetus in utero; and\n- research on the separated human fetus or on fetal tissue.\nThis chapter does not apply to research involving:\n- gametes, embryos and/or participants in assisted reproductive treatments — this research\nis covered by the Ethical guidelines on the use of assisted reproductive technology in\nclinical practice and research;\n- embryos excess to the needs of those for whom they were created using assisted\nreproductive technology — this research is covered by Australian legislation.\nSECTION 4 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO PARTICIPANTS\nCHAPTER 4.1: WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT AND THE HUMAN FETUS",

Fetal tissue is regarded as part of the fetus prior to separation\nof the fetus from the woman.\nAfter separation, the following Chapter of the National Statement may also be relevant to the\ndesign and conduct of research involving fetal tissue: Chapter 3.2: Human biospecimens in\nlaboratory based research.\nResearch to which this chapter applies must be reviewed and approved by a Human Research\nEthics Committee (HREC) rather than by one of the other processes of ethics review described\nin 5.1.12, except where that research satisfies the eligibility requirements for research that can be\nexempted from ethics review (see 5.1.17).\nValues, principles and themes that must inform the design, ethical review and conduct of all human\nresearch are set out in Sections 1 and 2 of the National Statement. The guidelines and headings\nbelow show how those values, principles and themes apply specifically in research that is the\nsubject of this chapter.\nGuidelines\nThe woman who is pregnant and the fetus in utero\n4.1.1 The wellbeing and care of the woman who is pregnant and of her fetus always takes\nprecedence over research considerations.\n4.1.2 The research participation of a young person who is pregnant should be guided by the\nrequirements of Chapter 4.2: Children and young people.\n4.1.3 Research involving the woman may affect the fetus, and research involving the fetus\nwill affect the woman. The risks and benefits to each should be carefully considered in\nevery case, and should be discussed with the woman. This must include the effect of the\nresearch on the fetus in utero (including consideration of fetal stress) and on the child\nwho may subsequently be born.\n4.1.4 The possibility of providing access to counselling for the woman about these issues\nshould be part of this discussion.\n4.1.5 Researchers should ask the woman whether, in her decisions about the research,\nshe wishes to involve others for whom the research may have implications.\n4.1.6 Except in the case of therapeutic innovative therapy, the process of providing\ninformation and obtaining consent for involvement in research should be separate\nfrom clinical care. Information about research projects should also be separate from\ninformation about routine clinical care.\n4.1.7 If it is consistent with promoting the life and health of the fetus, research on the fetus in\nutero may be ethically acceptable. Such research may, for example, provide information\nabout the health of the fetus.\n4.1.8 Research should be designed so as to minimise pain or distress for the fetus, and should\ninclude steps for monitoring for signs of fetal pain or distress, and steps for suspending\nor ceasing the research if necessary.\n4.1.9 ‘Innovations in clinical practice’ should be considered for any innovative therapy\ninvolving the fetus.

Where a treating\nhealth professional is also involved in the research, any conflict of interest (for example,\none which may arise from a financial or contractual relationship) will need to be\nmanaged in accordance with 5.4.3 of the National Statement. In cases where pregnancy\nis to be terminated, the possibility of contributing fetal tissue to research must not be\nraised until a decision to terminate has been made. Proposals for research must include\nprocedures to ensure that the process of providing information and obtaining consent\nfor involvement in the research is clearly separated from clinical care. For example:\n- A researcher who is also the treating health professional should not be the\nperson who seeks the consent of the potential participant unless there is a\nspecific justification for doing so (see Introduction to Chapter 3.1: Elements\nof Research).\n- Information sheets for research projects must be completely separate from,\nand capable of being read independently of, written information provided\nto a patient in the course of routine clinical care.\n4.1.12 Researchers should demonstrate that there are no suitable alternatives by which the\naims of research using the separated human fetus or fetal tissue can be achieved.\n4.1.13 There should be no trade in human fetal tissue.\n4.1.14 Those who conscientiously object to being involved in conducting research with separated\nfetuses or fetal tissue should not be compelled to participate, nor should they be put at\na disadvantage because of their objection.\n4.1.15 Where research involves a separated fetus, researchers should ask the woman whether,\nin her decisions about the research, she wishes to involve others for whom the research\nmay have implications.\n4.1.16 A fetus or fetal tissue may become available for research as the result of termination.\nThe process through which the woman is approached, informed about, and her consent\nsought for research on that fetus should be separate from the process under which\nshe decides whether to terminate her pregnancy, and should not begin until a decision\nto terminate has been made. Consenting to the research must not compromise the\nwoman’s freedom to change that decision.\n4.1.17 Where research involves her separated fetus or its fetal tissue, arrangements should be\nmade for the woman to have access to counselling and support.\n4.1.18 Research on a terminated fetus or its tissues, including the timing and content of the\nprocess of seeking the woman’s consent for the research, should be designed so as not\nto compromise the woman’s decisions about the timing and method of termination.\n4.1.19 Consideration of a woman’s wishes and her physical, psychological and emotional\nwelfare should inform:\n(a)  a decision whether to approach her about proposed research involving her,\nher separated fetus or its tissue; and\n(b)  if she is approached, the way information is provided about the research and\nher consent for it sought.\nSECTION 4 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO PARTICIPANTS\nCHAPTER 4.1: WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT AND THE HUMAN FETUS",

However, they assume\nspecial prominence in educational and health research, where there are particular tensions between\nnot placing children at risk in studies of new interventions and the need for knowledge about how\nsuch interventions are best used for children.\nResearchers must respect the developing capacity of children and young people to be involved\nin decisions about participation in research. The child or young person’s particular level of\nmaturity has implications for whether his or her consent is necessary and/or sufficient to\nauthorise participation. Different levels of maturity and of the corresponding capacity to be\ninvolved in the decision include:\n(a)  infants, who are unable to take part in discussion about the research and its effects;\n(b)  young children, who are able to understand some relevant information and take part\nin limited discussion about the research, but whose consent is not required;\n(c)  young people of developing maturity, who are able to understand the relevant information\nbut whose relative immaturity means that they remain vulnerable. The consent of these\nyoung people is required, but is not sufficient to authorise research; and\n(d)  young people who are mature enough to understand and consent, and are not vulnerable\nthrough immaturity in ways that warrant additional consent from a parent or guardian.\nIt is not possible to attach fixed ages to each level — they vary from child to child. Moreover, a child\nor young person may at the one time be at different levels for different research projects,\ndepending on the kind and complexity of the research. Being responsive to developmental levels\nis important not only for judging when children or young people are able to give their consent for\nresearch: even young children with very limited cognitive capacity should be engaged at their level\nin discussion about the research and its likely outcomes.\nValues, principles and themes that must inform the design, ethical review and conduct of all human\nresearch are set out in Sections 1 and 2 of the National Statement.

These risks may be temporary or permanent. People can become highly\ndependent on those interventions and treatments and may be incapable of comprehending their\nsituation or of communicating about it. At the same time, research on those interventions and\ntreatments is necessary to assess and improve their efficacy.\nThis chapter describes conditions under which research involving people highly dependent on\nmedical care might proceed although their capacity to give consent is limited or non-existent.\nIn every instance, relevant jurisdictional laws will need to be taken into account.\nSignificant ethical issues are raised by research conducted in the following settings:\n- neonatal intensive care;\n- terminal care;\n- emergency care;\n- intensive care; and\n- the care of unconscious people.\nResearch to which this chapter applies must be reviewed and approved by a Human Research\nEthics Committee (HREC) rather than by one of the other processes of ethics review described\nin 5.1.12, except where that research satisfies the eligibility requirements for research that can be\nexempted from ethics review (see 5.1.17).\nValues, principles and themes that must inform the design, ethical review and conduct of all human\nresearch are set out in Sections 1 and 2 of the National Statement.

Provision should be made for them to receive\ninformation, and to express their wishes, in other ways.\n4.4.6 In emergency care research, recruitment into a research project often has to be\nachieved rapidly. Where the research involves emergency treatment and meets the\nrequirements of 4.4.1, consent for the research may be waived provided the conditions\nof 2.3.10 are satisfied.\n4.4.7 In intensive care research, heavy sedation may impair participants’ cognition,\nand communication is difficult with people receiving ventilatory assistance.\nWhenever possible, consent to intensive care research, based on adequate information,\nshould be sought from or on behalf of potential participants before admission to that\nlevel of treatment. When prior consent to research is not possible, the process\ndescribed in 4.4.9 to 4.4.14 should be followed.\n4.4.8 In research with unconscious people, the participants cannot be informed about the\nresearch and their wishes cannot be determined. Those who are unconscious should\nbe included only in minimally invasive research, or in research designed both to be\ntherapeutic for them and to improve treatment for the condition from which they suffer.\nProcess to be followed\n4.4.9 Consent should be sought from people highly dependent on medical care wherever they\nare capable of giving consent and it is practicable to approach them.\n4.4.10 Where it is not practicable to approach a person highly dependent on medical care,\nor the person is not capable of making such a decision, consent should be sought from\nthe participant’s guardian, or person or organisation authorised by law, except under\nthe circumstances described in 4.4.13.\nSECTION 4 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO PARTICIPANTS\nCHAPTER 4.4: PEOPLE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON MEDICAL CARE WHO MAY BE UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT",

They are discussed in the\none chapter, however, because many of the ethical issues they raise about research participation\nare very similar.\nPeople with a cognitive impairment, an intellectual disability, or a mental illness are entitled\nto participate in research. While research involving these people need not be limited to their\nparticular impairment, disability or illness, their distinctive vulnerabilities as research participants\nshould be taken into account.\nThe capacity of a person with any of these conditions to consent to research, and the ability to\nparticipate in it, can vary for many reasons, including:\n- the nature of the condition;\n- the person’s medication or treatment;\n- the person’s discomfort or distress;\n- the complexity of the research project;\n- fluctuations in the condition. For example, while intellectual disability is usually permanent,\ncognitive impairment and mental illness are often temporary or episodic.\nEven when capable of giving consent and participating, people with these conditions may be\nmore-than-usually vulnerable to various forms of discomfort and stress.\nResearch to which this chapter applies must be reviewed and approved by a Human Research\nEthics Committee (HREC) rather than by one of the other processes of ethics review described\nin 5.1.12, except where that research satisfies the eligibility requirements for research that can be\nexempted from ethics review (see 5.1.17).\nValues, principles and themes that must inform the design, ethical review and conduct of all human\nresearch are set out in Sections 1 and 2 of the National Statement.

Such research may:\n- be intended to study, and perhaps to expose, illegal activity;\n- be not specifically intended to discover illegal activity, but likely to do so;\n- discover illegal activity inadvertently and unexpectedly.\nIn the first category there may be particular ethical questions about participants’ consent\n(see Chapter 2.2: General requirements for consent). In all three categories both ethical and\nlegal questions for researchers and institutions might arise from:\n- what researchers might be obliged to disclose;\n- the vulnerability of participants and researchers because of discovery of participants’\nillegal activity (see 5.1.45(b)).\nLegal implications may include:\n- a statutory obligation for a researcher to disclose information revealed or discovered;\n- legal orders that compel disclosure of information obtained by a researcher.\nThis chapter is not concerned with investigation conducted as part of law enforcement. Nor does it\ncontain information or guidance about legal obligations of researchers arising from their conduct\nof any research that discovers illegal activity. Further, it is not the role of a Human Research\nEthics Committee (HREC) or other ethical review body to provide legal advice on the existence\nor performance of any of those obligations.\nResearch to which this chapter applies must be reviewed and approved by a Human Research\nEthics Committee (HREC) rather than by one of the other processes of ethics review described\nin 5.1.12, except where that research satisfies the eligibility requirements for research that can be\nexempted from ethics review (see 5.1.17).\nValues, principles and themes that must inform the design, ethical review and conduct of all human\nresearch are set out in Sections 1 and 2 of the National Statement.

There are wide variations in the ways in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander individuals, communities or groups are involved in or affected by research to which\nthis chapter applies. The variations depend on the scope of the project, the demographics\nof participants, the illnesses or social phenomena under study, and their historical, social\nand cultural context and connections.\nResearchers should address relevant issues of research design, ethics, culture and language.\nDepending on the field of study and complexity of the proposed research, these issues might\nbe addressed in numerous ways. A cornerstone of an ethical research relationship with Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander Peoples is respect for and valuing of cultural and language diversity.\nFor health research fitting the above description, researchers must consult Ethical conduct in\nresearch with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and communities: Guidelines for\nresearchers and stakeholders.\nOther documents that might provide useful guidance for researchers are Keeping Research on Track II,\nthe AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research (2020) and A Guide to\nApplying the AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research (2020).\nHuman Research Ethics Committees (HRECs) are also required to apply the Ethical conduct\nin research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and communities: Guidelines\nfor researchers and stakeholders as the basis for assessing proposals for health research\nwith Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation.\nIn applying Sections 1 and 2 of the National Statement, researchers from other disciplines, HRECs and\nother ethical review bodies may also find the Ethical conduct in research with Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander Peoples and communities: Guidelines for researchers and stakeholders informative.\nThe Ethical conduct in research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and communities:\nGuidelines for researchers and stakeholders are based on six core values identified as being\nimportant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. The message for researchers is that\nthere is great diversity across the many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and societies.\nApplication of these core values, and of additional cultural and local-language protocols, should\nbe determined by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities or groups involved in\nthe research. The six core values are:\n- Reciprocity\n- Respect\n- Equality\n- Responsibility\n- Survival and protection\n- Spirit and integrity.6\n6 ‘The six core principles in Ethical conduct in research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and communities:\nGuidelines for researchers and stakeholders  have been updated as follows: Spirit and integrity, Cultural continuity, Equity,\nReciprocity, Respect, Responsibility\nSECTION 4 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO PARTICIPANTS\nCHAPTER 4.7: ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PEOPLES",

The Section also covers the operations of Human Research\nEthics Committees (HRECs), monitoring responsibilities, conflicts of interest, complaints\nmanagement and accountability.\nRequirements and guidance for the integrity and the responsible conduct of research are more fully\naddressed in the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research and supporting guides.\nChapter 5.1  Governance responsibilities\nof institutions\nIntroduction\nAll research should be developed, reviewed, authorised, conducted and monitored in accordance\nwith a research governance framework as described in an institution’s policy.\nA key component of a research governance framework is the requirement that research must\nundergo ethics review in accordance with the requirements of the National Statement. In addition\nto ethics approval, research must also be authorised by each institution with responsibility for\noversight of the research, before it can proceed. Authorisation of research by the institution\nshould take into account, but not re-review, any issues raised during the ethics review of the\nresearch proposal.\nThe National Statement supports the idea that the risk level of the proposed research should\nguide the institution in determining the level of ethics review that is appropriate. Ethics review\nprocesses that reflect the proportionate level of risk associated with a specific research project\nare set out in Chapter 5.1. Therefore, each institution should have a process or processes for\nassessing the risk level of the research. These processes may involve seeking advice from\nrelevant clinical or administrative staff, members of an ethics review committee or a meeting of\nthe HREC. The decision as to whether to grant an exemption from review for a research project\nis the responsibility of the institution — it is not the responsibility of the researcher.\nThe establishment and maintenance of ethics review processes and processes for assessing the risk\nlevel of the research are part of an institution’s overall governance responsibility.\nFor further guidance on governance of clinical trial research, institutions and researchers may\nwish to consult the National Clinical Trials Governance Framework developed by the Australian\nCommission on Safety and Quality in Health Care.",

HRECs may conduct both scientific and ethics review or may delegate\nscientific review to a sub-committee.7\nVarying processes may be used for the review and approval of project extensions, amendments\nto an approved project, progress reports and renewal of project approval. Appropriate processes\ndepend on the nature of the original project and any proposed changes, but any process authorised\nby an institution for these purposes must prioritise the safety and well-being of participants,\nresearchers and/or the community.\nGuidelines\nEthics review body procedures\nOperating procedures\n5.2.1 An HREC must ensure that it documents, implements and publicises standard operating\nprocedures that promote good ethics review, including:\n(a)  frequency of meetings;\n(b)  attendance at meetings;\n(c)  conduct of meetings;\n(d)  preparation of agendas and minutes;\n(e)  timely distribution of papers to members before meetings;\n(f)  timely consideration of applications;\n(g)  methods of deliberation and decision-making;\n(h)  processes, if any, for reviewing applications from unaffiliated or international researchers;\n(i)  disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest (see Chapter 5.6);\n(j)  appropriate confidentiality of the content of applications and the deliberations of\nreview bodies;\n(k)  prompt notification of decisions to researchers;\n(l)  communicating with researchers, including face to face, by telephone and in writing,\n(including available forms of electronic communication) (see 5.2.12 to 5.2.15);\n(m)  record keeping (see 5.2.16 to 5.2.21)\n(n)  monitoring of approved research (see Chapter 5.4)\n(o)  reporting and handling of adverse events\n(p)  receiving and handling of complaints (see Chapter 5.7: Complaints)\n7 For the purposes of the National Statement, HREC usually refers to the committee organised for the purpose of a meeting.\nUsers of the National Statement should also refer to 5.1.29–5.1.35 and 5.2.9–5.2 10 for clarification of the use of the term\nHREC in various contexts.\nSECTION 5 RESEARCH GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS REVIEW\nCHAPTER 5.2: RESPONSIBILITIES OF HRECS AND OTHER ETHICS REVIEW BODIES",

For some types of complex research, regulatory agencies may also be\ninvolved in monitoring activities.\nPrimary responsibility for ensuring that research is reliably monitored lies with the institution/s\nunder whose auspices the research is conducted. Within an institution, the delegation of monitoring\nresponsibilities should be consistent with that institution’s policies and may include delegating\nresponsibility for aspects of monitoring to oversight committees, experts within the organisation\nor administrative staff. Delegations of this kind are appropriate and should be supported.\nMonitoring responsibilities that are performed by the institution’s HREC should be based on the\nHREC’s review of the project. However, where research that will take place at multiple sites has\nbeen reviewed by only one HREC, the HRECs of the other institutions participating in the project\ndo not have knowledge of the project. In such cases, only the reviewing HREC can take on those\nelements of monitoring a research project that are commonly performed by HRECs.\nSponsors of clinical trial research also have significant monitoring and reporting responsibilities\nand allocation of monitoring responsibilities amongst sponsors, institutions, review bodies and\nresearchers should be clear to all of these for each research project. In addition, an institution\nmay function as the sponsor of the research or as the coordinator of a multi-centre research project\nand/or as the host for the body conducting the ethics review, as well as being a participating site\n(or group of sites). Accordingly, institutions should be clear and transparent about which of their\nmonitoring responsibilities are associated with which role.\nFor more information on monitoring of research and its place in the governance of research,\nthere are additional resources available from NHMRC and the Australian Government Department\nof Health.\nGuidelines\nMonitoring approved research\n5.4.1 Each institution has ultimate responsibility for ensuring, via its research governance\narrangements, that all its authorised research is monitored.\n5.4.2 Monitoring arrangements should be commensurate with the risk, size and complexity of\nthe research.\n5.4.3 There are a wide variety of mechanisms and strategies that can be employed to\nmonitor research. These mechanisms include the review or conduct of:\n(a)  reports from researchers, received at least annually;\n(b)  reports from independent committees or groups (such as a Data And Safety Monitoring\nBoard (DSMB));\n(c)  adverse event and other safety reports;\n(d)  amendments to the research project submitted by researchers;\n(e)  interviews or meetings with researchers;\n(f)  reports of internal project audits;\n(g)  audits of research documentation conducted by institutions or review bodies;",

The unnecessary duplication of\nethics review can delay the commencement of research that may be directly or indirectly beneficial\nto the Australian community and can waste valuable resources.\nThe National Statement encourages the minimisation of any unnecessary duplication of ethics\nreview both within and across research sectors. This extends to research that will be conducted in\nmore than one Australian jurisdiction or across international boundaries.\nWhere ethics review is required, the National Statement does not require that this review is done\nby an ethics review body that belongs to the institution/s where the research is to be conducted.\nAs noted, ethics review and approval must be accompanied by authorisation of research by\ninstitutions with a responsibility to oversee the research. The National Statement supports the\nminimisation of any unnecessary duplication of processes that may be used in the authorisation\nof multi-centre research.\nGuidelines\n5.5.1 Wherever more than one institution has a governance responsibility to ensure\nthat ethics review of a human research project has taken place (see 5.1.2 to 5.1.3),\neach institution has the further responsibility to adopt a review or authorisation process\nthat minimises any unnecessary duplication of ethics review.\n5.5.2 Institutions that will serve as individual sites for a multi-centre research project should\nmake every effort to avoid multiple ethics reviews of the same research project,\nother than specialised review that may be required. This principle applies to all types of\nresearch and to both research that will be reviewed by an HREC and research that will\nbe reviewed using a process that is appropriate for lower risk research (see 5.1.12).\nSECTION 5 RESEARCH GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS REVIEW\nCHAPTER 5.5: MINIMISING DUPLICATION OF ETHICS REVIEW",

Researchers, members\nof review bodies and institutions must disclose these interests to institutions, review bodies,\nfunding bodies, research participants, publishers and journal editors, collaborators and the public.\nThe information on disclosure of interests and conflicts of interest in this chapter is taken from\nDisclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest, a guide supporting the Australian\nCode for the Responsible Conduct of Research.\nA conflict of interest exists where an independent observer might reasonably conclude that the\nprofessional actions of a person are or may be unduly influenced by other interests. In the context\nof research, it exists where a person’s individual interests or responsibilities have the potential to\ninfluence the carrying out of their institutional role or professional obligations in research or where\nan institution’s interests or responsibilities have the potential to influence the carrying out of its\nresearch obligations.\nWhile a conflict may relate to financial interests, it can also relate to personal, familial, professional\nor organisational benefits or advantages that depend significantly on or could unduly influence\nresearch outcomes.\nThe perception that a conflict of interest is not properly identified or managed is a serious matter\nand can raise concerns about the integrity of individuals or the management practices of the\ninstitution, potentially undermining community trust in research.\nWhether an activity or an affiliation, association or relationship gives rise to a conflict of interest\nis a determination to be made by the appropriate decision maker. In making this determination,\nit should be recognised that having multiple interests does not necessarily constitute a conflict\nof interest and that having a conflict of interest does not, in itself, imply improper motivation or\nindividual wrongdoing.\nGuidelines\n5.6.1 Institutions should establish transparent processes that facilitate the disclosure of\ninterests and the identification and management of actual and potential conflicts of\ninterest involving:\n(a) the institution itself;\n(b) ethics review bodies, their members or advisors; or\n(c) researchers.\n5.6.2 An institution with a conflict of interest bearing on research should inform relevant\nethics review bodies about the conflict. Accordingly, where an ethics review body\nbecomes aware that there may be a conflict of interest involving the institution,\nthe review body should notify the institution.\nSECTION 5 RESEARCH GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS REVIEW\nCHAPTER 5.6: DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS AND MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST",

The primary aims of the NSQHS Standards\nare to protect the public from harm and to improve\nthe quality of health service provision. They provide\na quality assurance mechanism that tests whether\nrelevant systems are in place to ensure that expected\nstandards of safety and quality are met.\nThere are eight NSQHS Standards, which cover\nhigh-prevalence adverse events, preventing\nand controlling infections, medication safety,\ncomprehensive care, clinical communication, the\nprevention and management of pressure injuries,\nthe prevention of falls, and responding to clinical\ndeterioration. Importantly, these NSQHS Standards\nhave provided a nationally consistent statement\nabout the standard of care consumers can expect\nfrom their health service organisations.\nThe eight NSQHS Standards are:\nClinical Governance, which describes the\nclinical governance, and safety and quality\nsystems that are required to maintain and\nimprove the reliability, safety and quality of\nhealth care, and improve health outcomes\nfor patients.\nPartnering with Consumers, which describes\nthe systems and strategies to create a person-\ncentred health system by including patients in\nshared decision making, to ensure that\npatients are partners in their own care, and\nthat consumers are involved in the\ndevelopment and design of quality health care.\nPreventing and Controlling Infections,\nwhich describes the systems and strategies to\nprevent infection, manage infections\neffectively when they occur, limit the\ndevelopment of antimicrobial resistance\nthrough prudent use of antimicrobials (as\npart of effective antimicrobial stewardship),\nand promote appropriate and sustainable use\nof infection prevention and control resources.\nMedication Safety, which describes the\nsystems and strategies to ensure that\nclinicians safely prescribe, dispense and\nadminister appropriate medicines to\ninformed patients, and monitor use of the\nmedicines.\nComprehensive Care, which describes the\nintegrated screening, assessment and risk\nidentification processes for developing an\nindividualised care plan, to prevent and\nminimise the risks of harm in identified\nareas.\nCommunicating for Safety, which\ndescribes the systems and strategies for\neffective communication between patients,\ncarers and families, multidisciplinary teams\nand clinicians, and across the health service\norganisation.\nBlood Management, which describes the\nsystems and strategies for the safe,\nappropriate, efficient and effective care of\npatients’ own blood, as well as other\nsupplies of blood and blood products.\nRecognising and Responding to Acute\nDeterioration, which describes the systems\nand processes to respond effectively to\npatients when their physical, mental or\ncognitive condition deteriorates.\nEach standard contains:\n- A description of the standard\n- A statement of intent\n- A list of criteria that describe the key areas\ncovered by the standard\n- Explanatory notes on the content of the standard\n- Item headings for groups of actions in each\ncriterion\n- Actions that describe what is required to meet\nthe standard.",

    "text": "2\nNSQHS Standards\nThe NSQHS Standards require the implementation\nof organisation-wide systems for clinical\ngovernance, partnering with consumers,\npreventing and controlling infections,\nmedication safety, comprehensive care, effective\ncommunication, blood management, and\nrecognising and responding to acute deterioration.\nThe 2021 version of the NSQHS Standards (second\nedition) includes the Preventing and Controlling\nInfections Standard, which supersedes the NSQHS\nPreventing and Controlling Healthcare-Associated\nInfection Standard (2nd ed.). The revision\naccommodates lessons learned from the response\nto SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and better supports\nhealth service organisations to prevent, control\nand respond to infections that cause outbreaks,\nepidemics or pandemics, including novel and\nemerging infections.\nThe Clinical Governance Standard and the\nPartnering with Consumers Standard set the\noverarching system requirements for the effective\nimplementation of the remaining six standards,\nwhich consider specific high-risk clinical areas\nof patient care. The NSQHS Standards describe\nthe patient care journey and are designed to\nbe implemented in an integrated way. Similar\nimplementation strategies apply to multiple actions\nacross the NSQHS Standards. It is important to\nidentify the links between actions across each of\nthe eight NSQHS Standards. This will help health\nservice organisations to ensure that their safety\nand quality systems are integrated, and reduce the\nduplication of effort in implementing the eight\nstandards separately.\nImportant improvements in the safety and quality\nof patient care have been documented following\nimplementation of the first edition of the NSQHS\nStandards from 2011, including:\n- A decline in the Staphylococcus aureus\nbacteraemia rate per 10,000 patient days under\nsurveillance between 2010 and 2014, from 1.1 to\n0.87 cases\n- A drop in the yearly number of methicillin-\nresistant S. aureus bacteraemia cases between\n2010 and 2014, from 505 to 389\n- A decline of almost one-half in the national rate\nof central line-associated bloodstream infections\nbetween 2012–13 and 2013–14, from 1.02 to 0.6\nper 1,000 line days\n- Greater prioritisation of antimicrobial stewardship\nactivities in health service organisations\n- Better documentation of adverse drug reactions\nand medication history\n- Reduction in yearly red blood cell issues by the\nNational Blood Authority between mid-2010 and\nmid-2015, from approximately 800,000 units to\n667 ,000 units\n- Declining rates of in-hospital cardiac arrest and\nintensive care unit admissions following cardiac\narrests.\nThe Commission has worked closely with\npartners to review the NSQHS Standards and\ndevelop the second edition, embedding person-\ncentred care and addressing the needs of people\nwho may be at greater risk of harm. The NSQHS\nStandards (2nd ed.) set requirements for providing\ncomprehensive care for all patients, and include\nactions related to health literacy, end-of-life care,\ncare for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,\nand care for people with lived experience of mental\nillness or cognitive impairment.\nMore information\nA range of other supporting resources to assist\nhealth service organisations to implement\nthe NSQHS Standards are available on the\nCommission’s website.\nThe Advice Centre provides support for health\nservice organisations, surveyors and accrediting\nagencies on NSQHS Standards implementation.\nEmail: accreditation@safetyandquality.gov.au\nPhone: 1800 304 056",

At the level of the individual\nPartnerships relate to the interaction between\nclinicians and patients when care is provided.\nAt this level, a partnership involves providing\ncare that is respectful; sharing information in\nan ongoing way; working with patients, carers\nand families to make decisions and plan care;\nand supporting and encouraging patients in\ntheir own care.\n2. At the level of a service, department or program\nof care\nPartnerships relate to the organisation and\ndelivery of care within specific areas. At this\nlevel, a partnership involves the participation\nof patients, carers, families and consumers in\nthe overall design of the service, department\nor program. This could be as full members of\nquality improvement and redesign teams, and\nparticipating in planning, implementing and\nevaluating change.\n3. At the level of the health service\nPartnerships relate to the involvement of\nconsumers in overall governance, policy and\nplanning. This level overlaps with the previous\nlevel, since a health service is made up of various\nservices, departments and programs. At this\nlevel, partnerships relate to the involvement of\nconsumers and consumer representatives as\nfull members of key organisational governance\ncommittees in areas such as patient safety,\nfacility design, quality improvement, patient\nor family education, ethics and research. This\nlevel can also involve partnerships with local\ncommunity organisations and members of local\ncommunities.\nDelivering care that is based on partnerships\nprovides many benefits for patients, consumers,\nclinicians, health service organisations and the\nhealth system. Effective partnerships, a positive\nexperience for patients, and high-quality health care\nand improved safety are linked.9-11 The involvement\nof patients and consumers in planning, delivery,\nmonitoring and evaluation can also have a positive\neffect on service planning and development,\ninformation development and dissemination, and\nthe attitudes of healthcare providers.9,12,13 Delivering\nhealth care that is based on partnerships can result\nin reduced hospital costs, lower cost per case and\nreduced length of stay.14,15",

It was revised to\naccommodate lessons learned from the response\nto SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and to better support\nhealth service organisations to prevent, control\nand respond to infections that cause outbreaks,\nepidemics or pandemics, including novel and\nemerging infections.\nThe amendments provide clarification of the\nscope of the standard, and additional information\nabout actions, to better support implementation of\npolicies, processes and systems that ensure a safe\nenvironment for patients, consumers and members\nof the workforce. The Australian Guidelines for the\nControl and Prevention of Infection in Healthcare17 are\nappended to ensure ready access to the principal\nresource for development and implementation of\nsystems to meet the requirements of this standard.\nThe revision extends the scope of the standard to\nprevention and control of any infection that may be\ntransmitted within a health service organisation,\nregardless of where the infection was acquired.\nThe revisions relate primarily to standard and\ntransmission-based precautions; screening\nand management of healthcare workers with\ntransmissible infections; environmental cleaning;\nenvironmental and engineering controls; and\nother controls to protect patients, consumers and\nmembers of the workforce from infection.\nThe revision also includes an item to emphasise\nprotection and management of members of the\nworkforce with transmissible infections, which\nwas not explicit in the NSQHS Preventing and\nControlling Healthcare-Associated Infection\nStandard (2nd ed.). This is not a new requirement in\nrelation to either work health and safety or infection\nprevention and control. Meeting work health and\nsafety obligations is clearly included in the following\nactions of the NSQHS Standards (2nd ed.):\n- 1.07c (Policies and Procedures: Review\ncompliance with legislation, regulation and\njurisdictional requirements)\n- 1.10c (Risk management: Acts to reduce risks)\n- 1.10f (Plans for, and manages, internal and\nexternal emergencies and disasters).\nIn addition, Section 4.2.2 and Table 32 of the\nAustralian Guidelines for the Control and Prevention of\nInfection in Healthcare provide guidance regarding\nexclusion periods for members of the workforce\nwith infectious illnesses.\nThere are also well-established jurisdictional\nlegislative and policy frameworks for work health\nand safety, which apply to clinical and non-clinical\nmembers of the workforce and consumers in health\nworkplaces. These complement this standard,\nwhich is patient-focused, while acknowledging the\ncomplementary relationship between healthcare\nworker and patient safety in infection prevention\nand control.\nExplicit reference to sustainable use of infection\nprevention and control resources has been included\nto highlight the importance of delivering high-quality\nhealth care by protecting natural, financial and\nhuman resources as much as possible, and minimising\nenvironmental damage.

They may also undergo invasive\nprocedures, have medical devices inserted, and\nreceive antimicrobials and immunosuppressive\ntherapies. All these conditions create ideal\nopportunities for the spread of infections and\ndevelopment of antimicrobial resistance.\nMicroorganisms evolve over time, and continue to\npresent new challenges for infection prevention\nand control. An increasing proportion of infections\nthat impact health service organisations originate\nin the community, including multidrug-resistant\norganisms. These organisms may affect patients,\nconsumers and members of the workforce.\nCurrently, some important areas of concern\ninclude the emergence and transmission of\nCOVID-19, multidrug-resistant bacteria such\nas carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales,\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,\nvancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and increases\nin the burden of Clostridioides difficile infection\npresenting to, and emerging in, health service\norganisations.\nEach year, many infections are associated with the\nprovision of health care and affect a large number\nof patients18, and, in some cases, consumers and\nmembers of the workforce. These infections:\n- Cause considerable harm and may increase risk\nof morbidity, and death\n- Increase use of health services – for example,\nextended length of stay, resulting in increased\nuse of health resources such as inpatient beds,\ntreatment options and investigations\n- Place greater demands on the clinical workforce.\nInfection prevention and control within healthcare\nsettings aims to minimise the risk of transmission\nof infections and the development of resistant\norganisms.\nNovel infections that cause outbreaks, epidemics\nor pandemics present new challenges, and require\nrapid responses to control and prevent further\nspread, while ensuring the safety of patients and\nmembers of the workforce, and sustainability of\nservice provision.\nAn effective risk management system for infection\nprevention and control involves the identification\nof hazards, and assessment and control of risks for\npatients, visitors and members of the workforce,\nso far as is reasonably practicable (what can be\ndone and what is possible in the circumstances\nfor ensuring health and safety and continuity of\nhealth service delivery). This approach requires\nconsultation, cooperation and coordination\nbetween the health service organisation, patients,\nconsumers and members of the workforce.\nThe ‘hierarchy of controls’ is a model used in work\nhealth and safety risk management. It is a step-by-\nstep approach to controlling hazards that ranks\ncontrols from most to least reliable (see diagram\nbelow). The hierarchy of controls, used in conjunction\nwith infection prevention and control systems,\nsupports design of health service organisation\ninfection prevention and control programs. If it is\nnot reasonably practical to eliminate risks, then risks\nmust be minimised as far as is reasonably practicable\nby using one or a combination of substitution,\nisolation or engineering controls. Administrative\ncontrols and personal protective equipment (PPE)\nshould then be considered.\nHierarchy of controls\nSource: Safe Work Australia.

These strategies encompass:\n- Sound and integrated corporate and clinical\ngovernance\n- Risk identification and practical management\n- Surveillance to identify areas for action\nand quality improvement activities (such as\nauditing of compliance with hand hygiene,\nPPE use and aseptic technique requirements\nand environmental cleaning performance,\nsurveillance of healthcare-associated infections,\nand water system surveillance)\n- Safe and appropriate prescribing and use of\nantimicrobial agents, guided by antimicrobial\nstewardship and consumer engagement\n- Safe and appropriate application of standard\nand transmission-based precautions, including\npatient placement and use of PPE.\nAlthough all infection prevention and control\nprograms have essential elements, as described\nin the Australian Guidelines for the Prevention and\nControl of Infection in Healthcare17, programs will\nbe tailored across health service organisations\nto reflect local context and risks. Not all clinical\nenvironments or activities have the same risks, or\npractically lend themselves to the ideal conditions\nto prevent cross-infection. When there is a concern\nthat a clinical activity is an infection risk for\npatients or members of the workforce, it is beneficial\nto map the clinical activity against points of risk\nand implement steps to reduce the transmission of\norganisms, without compromising safety.\nSystems and governance for infection prevention\nand control and infection surveillance in healthcare\nsettings must be consistent with relevant national\nguidance, including the Australian Guidelines for the\nPrevention and Control of Infection in Healthcare17,\nand relevant jurisdictional law and policy, including\nwork health and safety legislation.\nThe controls, and the infection prevention and\ncontrol measures required to respond to infection\nrisk, will be informed by assessment of available\nscientific evidence.\nWhen there is emerging or rapidly evolving scientific\nknowledge around an infection, or aspects of its\ntransmission, a precautionary approach aligned\nwith patient risk factors and the relevant clinical\nprocedure and setting is warranted. Infection\nprevention and control measures taken require\nongoing careful review as the scientific body of\nknowledge develops.",

    "text": "NSQHS Standards - Medication Safety Standard 37\nExplanatory notes\nMedicines are the most common treatment used in\nhealth care. Although appropriate use of medicines\ncontributes to significant improvements in health,\nmedicines can also be associated with harm. 21\nBecause they are so commonly used, medicines are\nassociated with a higher incidence of errors and\nadverse events than other healthcare interventions.\nSome of these adverse events are costly, and up to\n50% are potentially avoidable.22\nThe proportion of medicine-related hospital\nadmissions has been estimated at approximately\n2–3%.23 This proportion remains consistent,\nand, based on 2011–12 Australian hospital data\nof 9.3 million separations, suggests a medicine-\nrelated hospital admission rate of 230,000 annually.\nSome subpopulations have higher estimates – for\nexample, 12% of medical admissions and 20–30%\nof admissions for those aged 65 years and over.21\nStudies have also revealed an average of three\nmedicine-related problems per resident in aged care\nfacilities24, and 40–50% of residents being prescribed\npotentially inappropriate medicines. 25,26\nIn general practice, 8.5–12% of patients are reported\nto have experienced an adverse medicine event\nwithin the previous six months 27-29, consistent\nwith previous estimates of 10% of patients.30\nErrors affect both health outcomes for consumers\nand healthcare costs. The cost of such adverse\nevents to individual patients and the healthcare\nsystem is significant. A study published in\n2009 reported that medication-related hospital\nadmissions in Australia were estimated to cost\n$660 million.21 Estimates, with an average cost per\nseparation of $5,204 in 2011–12, place this figure\ncloser to $1.2 billion.21 The effects on patients’\nquality of life are more difficult to quantify.\nStandardising and systemising processes can\nimprove medication safety by preventing medication\nincidents. Other recognised solutions for reducing\ncommon causes of medication incidents include:\n- Improving governance and quality measures\nrelating to medication safety\n- Improving clinician–workforce communication\nand clinical handover\n- Improving clinician–patient communication and\npartnership\n- Using technology to support information\nrecording and transfer\n- Providing better access to patient information\nand clinical decision support.",

The\npurpose of the Comprehensive Care Standard is to\naddress the cross-cutting issues underlying many\nadverse events. These issues often include failures to:\n- Provide continuous and collaborative care\n- Work in partnership with patients, carers and\nfamilies to adequately identify, assess and\nmanage patients’ clinical risks, and find out their\npreferences for care\n- Communicate and work as a team (that is,\nbetween members of the healthcare team).\nProcesses for delivering comprehensive care will\nvary, even within a health service organisation. Take\na flexible approach to standardisation so that safety\nand quality systems support local implementation\nand innovation. Target screening, assessment,\ncomprehensive care planning and delivery processes\nto improve the safety and quality of care delivered to\nthe population that the organisation serves.\nAlthough this standard refers to actions needed\nwithin a single episode of patient care, it is\nfundamental that each single episode or period of\ncare is considered as part of the continuum of care\nfor a patient. Meaningful implementation of this\nstandard requires attention to the processes for\npartnering with patients in their own care, and for\nsafely managing transitions between episodes of\ncare. This requires that the systems and processes\nnecessary to meet the requirements of this standard\nalso meet the requirements of the Partnering with\nConsumers Standard and the Communicating for\nSafety Standard.\nMinimising patient harm\nImplement targeted, best-practice strategies to\nprevent and minimise the risk of specific harms\nidentified in this standard.\nPressure injuries\nPressure injuries can occur to patients of any\nage who have one or more of the following risk\nfactors: immobility, older age, lack of sensory\nperception, poor nutrition or hydration, excess\nmoisture or dryness, poor skin integrity, reduced\nblood flow, limited alertness or muscle spasms.\nEvidence-based strategies to prevent pressure\ninjuries exist and should be applied if screening\nidentifies that a patient is at risk.\nFalls\nFalls also occur in all age groups. However, the\nrisk of falls and the harm from falls vary between\nindividuals as a result of differences in factors\nsuch as eyesight, balance, cognitive impairment,\nmuscle strength, bone density and medicine\nuse. The Australian Commission on Safety and\nQuality in Health Care has developed evidence-\nbased guidelines for older people.31-33 Policies and\nprocedures for other age groups need to be based\non available evidence and best practice.\nPoor nutrition and malnutrition\nPatients with poor nutrition, including\nmalnutrition, are at greater risk of pressure injuries\nand their pressure injuries are more severe.8,34 They\nare also at greater risk of healthcare-associated\ninfections and mortality in hospital, and for up to\nthree years following discharge. 35-39 Malnutrition\nsignificantly increases length of hospital stay and\nunplanned readmissions. 37, 38,4 0 Ensure that patients\nat risk of poor nutrition are identified and that\nstrategies are put in place to reduce these risks.",

    "text": "Comprehensive Care Standard - NSQHS Standards46\nCognitive impairment\nPeople with cognitive impairment who are\nadmitted to hospital are at a significantly\nincreased risk of preventable complications such\nas falls, pressure injuries, delirium and failure to\nreturn to premorbid function, as well as adverse\noutcomes such as unexpected death, or early and\nunplanned entry into residential care. 41 People\nwith cognitive impairment may also experience\ndistress in unfamiliar and busy environments.\nAlthough cognitive impairment is a common\ncondition experienced by people in health\nservice organisations, it is often not detected, or\nis dismissed or misdiagnosed. Delirium can be\nprevented with the right care42, and harm can\nbe minimised if systems are in place to identify\ncognitive impairment and the risk of delirium,\nso that strategies can be incorporated in the\ncomprehensive care plan and implemented.\nUnpredictable behaviours\nPeople in healthcare settings can exhibit\nunpredictable behaviours that may lead to harm.\nHealth service organisations need systems to\nidentify situations where there is higher risk\nof harm, and strategies to mitigate or prevent\nthese risks. They also need systems to manage\nsituations in which harm relating to unpredictable\nbehaviour occurs. For the purpose of this standard,\nunpredictable behaviours include self-harm, suicide,\naggression and violence. It is important that systems\ndesigned to respond to the risks of unpredictable\nbehaviour minimise further trauma to patients and\nothers. This relates to both the material practices\nand the attitude with which care is delivered.\nProcesses to manage people who have thoughts\nof harming themselves, with or without suicidal\nintent, or who have actually harmed themselves are\nneeded. These processes need to provide physical\nsafety, and support to deal with psychological and\nother issues contributing to self-harm. The health\nservice organisation is responsible for ensuring that\nfollow-up services are arranged before the person\nleaves the health service, because of the known risks\nof self-harm after discharge. 43\nSome people are at higher risk of aggressive\nbehaviour as a result of impaired coping skills\nrelating to intoxication, acute physical deterioration\nor mental illness. Healthcare-related situations,\nsuch as waiting times, crowded or high-stimulus\nenvironments, and conflicts regarding treatment\ndecisions, can precipitate aggression. Members\nof the workforce need skills to identify the risk\nof aggression, and strategies to safely manage\naggression and violence when they do occur.\nRestrictive practices\nMinimising and, where possible, eliminating the\nuse of restrictive practices (including restraint and\nseclusion) are key parts of national mental health\npolicy.44,45 Minimising the use of restraint in other\nhealthcare settings besides mental health has also\nbeen identified as a clinical priority. Identifying\nrisks relating to unpredictable behaviour early and\nusing tailored response strategies can reduce the use\nof restrictive practices. Restrictive practices must\nonly be implemented by members of the workforce\nwho have been trained in their safe use. The health\nservice organisation needs processes to benchmark\nand review the use of restrictive practices.\nKey links with other standards\nTo implement systems that meet the requirements\nof the Comprehensive Care Standard, identify\nwhere there are synergies with the other NSQHS\nStandards. This will help ensure that the\norganisation’s safety and quality systems, policies\nand processes are integrated, and will reduce the\nrisk of duplication of effort arising from attempts\nto implement the eight standards separately.",

They include\ntransitions of care (clinical handover), when critical\ninformation about a patient’s care emerges or\nchanges, and when it is important to ensure that a\npatient is correctly identified and matched to their\nintended care.\nTo meet this standard, health service organisations\nare required to have systems and processes\nin place to support effective communication\nand documentation at these high-risk times.\nRecognising that communication is a variable\nprocess, organisations will need to develop, describe\nand adapt these systems to their service context to\nensure that communication processes are flexible,\nand appropriate for the nature of the organisation\nand the consumers who use their service.\nCommunication is inherent to patient care, and\ninformal communications will occur throughout\ncare delivery.

However, using biological materials,\nblood and blood products has some inherent risks.\nActions to minimise these risks include screening\nand testing donors and donated blood; and ensuring\nthat all treatment options, and their risks and\nbenefits, are considered before deciding to transfuse.\nThe scope of this standard covers all elements of the\nclinical process, including:\n- Making clinical decisions\n- Obtaining recipient samples and assessing\ncompatibility with donated products\n- Safely administering the products to the\nintended recipient\n- Storing and disposing of blood and blood\nproducts\n- Reporting and investigating any adverse\nreactions or incidents.\nThis standard also aims to ensure that safe,\nappropriate, effective and efficient blood\nmanagement systems are in place.\nThe standard supports the principles of good patient\nblood management that provide for clinically\nappropriate and safe management of patients while\navoiding transfusion of blood and blood products,\nand its associated risks.\nResearch and practice show that the dual approach\nof implementing governance structures and\nevidence-based clinical guidelines is the most\neffective way to ensure the appropriate and safe\nuse of blood and blood products.",

They include52-54:\n- Not monitoring physiological observations\nconsistently or not understanding observed\nchanges in physiological observations\n- Lack of knowledge of signs and symptoms that\ncould signal deterioration\n- Lack of awareness of the potential for a person’s\nmental state to deteriorate\n- Lack of awareness of delirium, and the benefits of\nearly recognition and treatment55\n- Lack of formal systems for responding to\ndeterioration\n- Lack of skills to manage patients who are\ndeteriorating\n- Failure to communicate clinical concerns,\nincluding during clinical handover\n- Attributing physical or mental symptoms to an\nexisting condition, such as dementia or a mental\nhealth condition.56,57\nSystems to recognise deterioration early and\nrespond to it appropriately need to deal with all\nof these factors, and need to be applied across\na healthcare facility. The National Consensus\nStatement: Essential elements for recognising and\nresponding to acute physiological deterioration48,\nwhich was developed by the Australian Commission\non Safety and Quality in Health Care (the\nCommission), has been endorsed by Australian\nhealth ministers as the national approach for\nrecognising and responding to clinical deterioration\nin acute care facilities in Australia. It provides\na consistent national model to support clinical,\norganisational and strategic efforts to improve\nrecognition and response systems. This standard\nbuilds on the national consensus statement to drive\nimplementation in acute care facilities.\nThe Commission’s National Consensus Statement:\nEssential elements for recognising and responding\nto deterioration in a person’s mental state outlines\nthe principles that underpin safe and effective\nresponses to deterioration in a person’s mental state,\nand provides information about the interrelated\ncomponents that a health service organisation can\nimplement to provide this care.\nThis standard applies to all patients – adults,\nadolescents, children and babies – in acute\nhealthcare facilities, and to all types of patients,\nincluding medical, surgical, maternity and mental\nhealth patients. Acute healthcare facilities range\nfrom large tertiary referral centres to small district\nand community hospitals.\nThe Commission’s Delirium Clinical Care\nStandard47 highlights the importance of being alert\nto, and assessing, delirium with any reported or\nobserved changes in a person’s mental state.",

An advance care planning discussion will\noften result in an advance care plan. Plans should be\nmade on the person’s behalf and prepared from the\nperson’s perspective to guide decisions about care.58\nadvanced life support: the preservation or\nrestoration of life by the establishment and/or\nmaintenance of airway, breathing and circulation\nusing invasive techniques such as defibrillation,\nadvanced airway management, intravenous access\nand drug therapy.48\nadverse drug reaction: a response to a medicine\nthat is noxious and unintended, and occurs at\ndoses normally used or tested in humans for the\nprophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease, or for\nthe modification of physiological function. 59 An\nallergy is a type of adverse drug reaction.\nadverse event: an incident that results, or could have\nresulted, in harm to a patient or consumer. A near\nmiss is a type of adverse event. See also near miss\nalert: warning of a potential risk to a patient.\nallergy: occurs when a person’s immune system\nreacts to allergens in the environment that are\nharmless for most people. Typical allergens include\nsome medicines, foods and latex.60 An allergen\nmay be encountered through inhalation, ingestion,\ninjection or skin contact.61 A medicine allergy is one\ntype of adverse drug reaction.\nantimicrobial: a chemical substance that inhibits or\ndestroys bacteria, viruses or fungi, and can be safely\nadministered to humans and animals. 62\nantimicrobial resistance: failure of an antimicrobial\nto inhibit a microorganism at the antimicrobial\nconcentrations usually achieved over time with\nstandard dosing regimens. 62\nantimicrobial stewardship: an ongoing effort by\na health service organisation to reduce the risks\nassociated with increasing antimicrobial resistance\nand to extend the effectiveness of antimicrobial\ntreatments. It may incorporate several strategies,\nincluding monitoring and review of antimicrobial\nuse.62\napproved identifiers: items of information accepted\nfor use in identification, including family and given\nnames, date of birth, sex, address, healthcare record\nnumber and Individual Healthcare Identifier. Health\nservice organisations and clinicians are responsible\nfor specifying the approved items for identification\nand procedure matching. Identifiers such as room or\nbed number should not be used.\naseptic technique: a technique that aims to prevent\nmicroorganisms on hands, surfaces and equipment\nfrom being introduced to susceptible sites. Unlike\nsterile techniques, aseptic techniques can be\nachieved in typical ward and home settings. 63\nassessment: a clinician’s evaluation of a disease\nor condition based on the patient’s subjective\nreport of the symptoms and course of the illness\nor condition, and the clinician’s objective findings.\nThese findings include data obtained through\nlaboratory tests, physical examination and medical\nhistory; and information reported by carers, family\nmembers and other members of the healthcare\nteam.

It ensures that everyone – from\nfrontline clinicians to managers and members of\ngoverning bodies, such as boards – is accountable\nto patients and the community for assuring the\ndelivery of safe, effective and high-quality services.\nClinical governance systems provide confidence to\nthe community and the healthcare organisation\nthat systems are in place to deliver safe and high-\nquality health care.\nclinical handover: the transfer of professional\nresponsibility and accountability for some or all\naspects of care for a patient, or group of patients,\nto another person or professional group on a\ntemporary or permanent basis. 70\nclinical information system: a computerised\nhealthcare record and management system that is\nused by clinicians in healthcare settings. Clinical\ninformation systems are typically organisation-\nwide, have high levels of security and access, and\nhave roles and rights (for example, prescribing\nmedicines, reviewing laboratory results,\nadministering intravenous fluids) specified for\neach clinical and administrative user. Clinical\ninformation systems enable electronic data entry\nand data retrieval by clinicians. 71\nclinical leaders: clinicians with management or\nleadership roles in a health service organisation\nwho can use their position or influence to change\nbehaviour, practice or performance. Examples are\ndirectors of clinical services, heads of units and\nclinical supervisors.\nclinician: a healthcare provider, trained as a\nhealth professional, including registered and non-\nregistered practitioners. Clinicians may provide care\nwithin a health service organisation as an employee,\na contractor or a credentialed healthcare provider,\nor under other working arrangements. They\ninclude nurses, midwives, medical practitioners,\nallied health practitioners, technicians, scientists\nand other clinicians who provide health care, and\nstudents who provide health care under supervision.\ncognitive impairment: deficits in one or more of\nthe areas of memory, communication, attention,\nthinking and judgement. This can be temporary or\npermanent. It can affect a person’s understanding,\ntheir ability to carry out tasks or follow instructions,\ntheir recognition of people or objects, how they\nrelate to others and how they interpret the\nenvironment. Dementia and delirium are common\nforms of cognitive impairment seen in hospitalised\nolder patients.41 Cognitive impairment can also be a\nresult of several other conditions, such as acquired\nbrain injury, a stroke, intellectual disability, licit or\nillicit drug use, or medicines.\ncold chain management: the system of transporting\nand storing temperature-sensitive medicines and\nother therapies, such as blood and blood products,\nwithin their defined temperature range at all times,\nfrom point of origin (manufacture) to point of\nadministration, to ensure that the integrity of the\nproduct is maintained.\ncommunicable: an infection that can be transferred\nfrom one person or host to another.\ncomprehensive care: health care that is based on\nidentified goals for the episode of care. These goals\nare aligned with the patient’s expressed preferences\nand healthcare needs, consider the impact of the\npatient’s health issues on their life and wellbeing,\nand are clinically appropriate.\ncomprehensive care plan: a document describing\nagreed goals of care, and outlining planned medical,\nnursing and allied health activities for a patient.\nComprehensive care plans reflect shared decisions\nmade with patients, carers and families about the\ntests, interventions, treatments and other activities\nneeded to achieve the goals of care. The content\nof comprehensive care plans will depend on the\nsetting and the service that is being provided, and\nmay be called different things in different health\nservice organisations. For example, a care or\nclinical pathway for a specific intervention may be\nconsidered a comprehensive care plan.\nconsumer: a person who has used, or may\npotentially use, health services, or is a carer for a\npatient using health services. A healthcare consumer\nmay also act as a consumer representative to provide\na consumer perspective, contribute consumer\nexperiences, advocate for the interests of current\nand potential health service users, and take part in\ndecision-making processes.72\ncontemporaneously (documenting information):\nrecording information in the healthcare record\nas soon as possible after the event that is being\ndocumented.73",

They include any objects that enter sterile\ntissue or the vascular system, because any microbial\ncontamination could transmit disease. 18\ncritical information: information that has\na considerable impact on a patient’s health,\nwellbeing or ongoing care (physical or psychological).\nThe availability of critical information may\nrequire a clinician to reassess or change a\npatient’s comprehensive care plan.\ncurrent medicines list: See medicines list\ndecision support tools: tools that can help\nclinicians and consumers to draw on available\nevidence when making clinical decisions. The\ntools have a number of formats. Some are explicitly\ndesigned to enable shared decision making (for\nexample, decision aids). Others provide some of the\ninformation needed for some components of the\nshared decision-making process (for example, risk\ncalculators, evidence summaries), or provide ways\nof initiating and structuring conversations about\nhealth decisions (for example, communication\nframeworks, question prompt lists).75 See also shared\ndecision making\nde-escalation strategies: psychosocial techniques\nthat aim to reduce violent or disruptive behaviour.\nThey are intended to reduce or eliminate the risk of\nviolence during the escalation phase, using verbal\nand non-verbal communication skills. De-escalation\nis about establishing rapport to gain the patient’s\ntrust, minimising restriction to protect their self-\nesteem, appearing externally calm and self-aware\nin the face of aggressive behaviour, and intuitively\nidentifying creative and flexible interventions that\nwill reduce the need for aggression.76\ndefinitive management: the treatment plan for a\ndisease or disorder that has been chosen as the best\none for the patient after all other choices have been\nconsidered.77\ndelirium: an acute disturbance of consciousness,\nattention, cognition and perception that tends to\nfluctuate during the day.78 It is a serious condition\nthat can be prevented in 30–40% of cases, and\nshould be treated promptly and appropriately.\nHospitalised older people with existing dementia\nare at the greatest risk of developing delirium.\nDelirium can be hyperactive (the person has\nheightened arousal; or can be restless, agitated and\naggressive) or hypoactive (the person is withdrawn,\nquiet and sleepy).79\ndeterioration in mental state: a negative change in\na person’s mood or thinking, marked by a change\nin behaviour, cognitive function, perception or\nemotional state. Changes can be gradual or acute;\nthey can be observed by members of the workforce,\nor reported by the person themselves, or their\nfamily or carers. Deterioration in a person’s mental\nstate can be related to several predisposing or\nprecipitating factors, including mental illness,\npsychological or existential stress, physiological\nchanges, cognitive impairment (including delirium),\nintoxication, withdrawal from substances, and\nresponses to social context and environment.\ndiversity: the varying social, economic and\ngeographic circumstances of consumers who\nuse, or may use, the services of a health service\norganisation, as well as their cultural backgrounds,\nreligions, beliefs, practices, languages spoken and\nsexualities (diversity in sexualities is currently\nreferred to as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and\nintersex, or LGBTI).\neffective clinical communication: two-way,\ncoordinated and continuous communication that\nresults in the timely, accurate and appropriate\ntransfer of information. Effective communication\nis critical to, and supports, the delivery of safe\npatient care.\nemergency assistance: clinical advice or assistance\nprovided when a patient’s condition has deteriorated\nseverely. This assistance is provided as part of the\nrapid response system, and is additional to the care\nprovided by the attending clinician or team. 48\nend of life: the period when a patient is living\nwith, and impaired by, a fatal condition, even if the",

Governance arrangements provide the\nstructure for setting the corporate objectives (social,\nfiscal, legal, human resources) of the organisation\nand the means to achieve the objectives. They\nalso specify the mechanisms for monitoring\nperformance. Effective governance provides a clear\nstatement of individual accountabilities within the\norganisation to help align the roles, interests and\nactions of different participants in the organisation\nto achieve the organisation’s objectives. In the\nNSQHS Standards, governance includes both\ncorporate and clinical governance.\ngoverning body: a board, chief executive officer,\norganisation owner, partnership or other highest\nlevel of governance (individual or group of\nindividuals) that has ultimate responsibility for\nstrategic and operational decisions affecting safety\nand quality in a health service organisation.\nguidelines: clinical practice guidelines are\nsystematically developed statements to assist\nclinician and consumer decisions about appropriate\nhealth care for specific circumstances. 83\nhaemovigilance: a set of surveillance procedures\ncovering the entire blood transfusion chain, from\nthe donation and processing of blood and its\ncomponents, to their provision and transfusion to\npatients, to their follow-up. It includes monitoring,\nreporting, investigating and analysing adverse\nevents related to the donation, processing and\ntransfusion of blood, as well as development and\nimplementation of recommendations to prevent the\noccurrence or recurrence of adverse events.84\nhand hygiene: a general term referring to any action\nof hand cleansing.\nhealth care: the prevention, treatment and\nmanagement of illness and injury, and the\npreservation of mental and physical wellbeing\nthrough the services offered by clinicians, such as\nmedical, nursing and allied health professionals. 6\nhealthcare-associated infections: infections that\nare acquired in healthcare facilities (nosocomial\ninfections) or that occur as a result of healthcare\ninterventions (iatrogenic infections). Healthcare-\nassociated infections may manifest after people\nleave the healthcare facility.18\nhealthcare record: includes a record of the patient’s\nmedical history, treatment notes, observations,\ncorrespondence, investigations, test results,\nphotographs, prescription records and medication\ncharts for an episode of care.\nhealth literacy: the Australian Commission on\nSafety and Quality in Health Care separates health\nliteracy into two components – individual health\nliteracy and the health literacy environment.\nIndividual health literacy is the skills, knowledge,\nmotivation and capacity of a consumer to access,\nunderstand, appraise and apply information to\nmake effective decisions about health and health\ncare, and take appropriate action.\nThe health literacy environment is the\ninfrastructure, policies, processes, materials, people\nand relationships that make up the healthcare\nsystem, which affect the ways in which consumers",

Because they have a low\nmargin of safety, the consequences of errors with\nhigh-risk medicines can be more devastating. 86,87\nAt a minimum, the following classes of high-risk\nmedicines should be considered:\n- Medicines with a narrow therapeutic index\n- Medicines that present a high risk when other\nsystem errors occur, such as administration via\nthe wrong route.\nhygienic environment: an environment in which\npractical prevention and control measures are used\nto reduce the risk of infection from contamination\nby microbes.\nincident (clinical): an event or circumstance that\nresulted, or could have resulted, in unintended or\nunnecessary harm to a patient or consumer; or a\ncomplaint, loss or damage. An incident may also be\na near miss. See also near miss\ninfection: the invasion and reproduction of\npathogenic (disease-causing) organisms inside the\nbody. This may cause tissue injury and disease. 88\ninformed consent: a process of communication\nbetween a patient and clinician about options for\ntreatment, care processes or potential outcomes.\nThis communication results in the patient’s\nauthorisation or agreement to undergo a specific\nintervention or participate in planned care. 89 The\ncommunication should ensure that the patient has\nan understanding of the care they will receive, all\nthe available options and the expected outcomes,\nincluding success rates and side effects for each\noption.90\ninjury: damage to tissues caused by an agent or\ncircumstance.91\ninvasive medical devices: devices inserted through\nskin, mucosal barrier or internal cavity, including\ncentral lines, peripheral lines, urinary catheters,\nchest drains, peripherally inserted central catheters\nand endotracheal tubes.\njurisdictional requirements: systematically\ndeveloped statements from state and territory\ngovernments about appropriate healthcare or\nservice delivery for specific circumstances. 83\nJurisdictional requirements encompass a number\nof types of documents from state and territory\ngovernments, including legislation, regulations,\nguidelines, policies, directives and circulars.\nTerms used for each document may vary by\nstate and territory.\nleadership: having a vision of what can be achieved,\nand then communicating this to others and evolving\nstrategies for realising the vision.

Health service delivery occurs in many\ndifferent ways, and the service context will depend\non the organisation’s function, size and organisation\nof care regarding service delivery mode, location and\nworkforce.116\nshared decision making: a consultation process in\nwhich a clinician and a patient jointly participate\nin making a health decision, having discussed the\noptions, and their benefits and harms, and having\nconsidered the patient’s values, preferences and\ncircumstances.75\nstandard: agreed attributes and processes designed\nto ensure that a product, service or method will\nperform consistently at a designated level.91",

    "text": "Glossary -  NSQHS Standards82\nNSQHS Standards\nstandard national terminologies:  a structured\nvocabulary used in clinical practice to accurately\ndescribe the care and treatment of patients.\nHealthcare providers around the world use\nspecialised vocabulary to describe diseases,\noperations, clinical procedures, findings, treatments\nand medicines. In Australia, terminologies include\nSNOMED CT-AU and Australian Medicines\nTer m inolog y.117 Standard national terminologies are\nalso referred to as clinical terminologies.\nstandard precautions: work practices that provide\na first-line approach to infection prevention and\ncontrol, and are used for the care and treatment of\nall patients.111\nstructured clinical handover:  a structured\nformat used to deliver information (the minimum\ninformation content), enabling all participants\nto know the purpose of the handover, and the\ninformation that they are required to know and\ncommunicate.64\nsubstitute decision-maker: a person appointed\nor identified by law to make health, medical,\nresidential and other personal (but not financial\nor legal) decisions on behalf of a patient whose\ndecision-making capacity is impaired. A substitute\ndecision-maker may be appointed by the patient,\nappointed for (on behalf of) the person, or identified\nas the default decision-maker by legislation, which\nvaries by state and territory.41\nsurveillance: an epidemiological practice that\ninvolves monitoring the spread of disease to\nestablish progression patterns. The main roles of\nsurveillance are to predict and observe spread; to\nprovide a measure for strategies that may minimise\nthe harm caused by outbreak, epidemic and\npandemic situations; and to increase knowledge\nof the factors that might contribute to such\ncircumstances. 88\nsystem: the resources, policies, processes and\nprocedures that are organised, integrated,\nregulated and administered to accomplish a\nstated goal. A system:\n- Brings together risk management, governance,\nand operational processes and procedures,\nincluding education, training and orientation\n- Deploys an active implementation plan; feedback\nmechanisms include agreed protocols and\nguidelines, decision support tools and other\nresource materials\n- Uses several incentives and sanctions to influence\nbehaviour and encourage compliance with policy,\nprotocol, regulation and procedures.\nThe workforce is both a resource in the system and\ninvolved in all elements of systems development,\nimplementation, monitoring, improvement and\nevaluation.\ntimely (communication): communication of\ninformation within a reasonable time frame.\nThis will depend on how important or time critical\nthe information is to a patient’s ongoing care\nor wellbeing, the context in which the service is\nprovided and the clinical acuity of the patient.\ntraceability: the ability to trace the history,\napplication or location of reusable medical devices.\nSome professional groups may refer to traceability\nas tracking.111\ntraining: the development of knowledge and skills.\ntransfusion history:  a list of transfusions a patient\nhas had before presentation, including details of\nany adverse reactions to the transfusion and any\nspecial transfusion requirements. The completeness\nof the history will depend on the availability of\ninformation. It is expected that information will\nbe obtained by reviewing any available referral\ninformation and interviewing the patient or\ntheir carer.\ntransitions of care: situations when all or part of\na patient’s care is transferred between healthcare\nlocations, providers, or levels of care within the\nsame location, as the patient’s conditions and care\nneeds change.118\ntransmission-based precautions: extra work\npractices used in situations when standard\nprecautions alone may not be enough to prevent\ntransmission of infection. Transmission-based\nprecautions are used in conjunction with standard\nprecautions.18\nworkforce: all people working in a health service\norganisation, including clinicians and any other\nemployed or contracted, locum, agency, student,\nvolunteer or peer workers. The workforce can\nbe members of the health service organisation\nor medical company representatives providing\ntechnical support who have assigned roles and\nresponsibilities for care of, administration of,\nsupport of, or involvement with patients in the\nhealth service organisation.

All rights reserved.\nWorld Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki\nEthical Principles for Medical Research\nInvolving Human Subjects\nWorld Medical Association\nAdopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by the:\n29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975\n35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983\n41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989\n48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996\n52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000\n53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington, DC, USA, October 2002 (Note of Clarification added)\n55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added)\n59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008\n64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013\nPreamble\n1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Dec-\nlaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medi-\ncal research involving human subjects, including research on\nidentifiable human material and data.\nThe Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of\nits constituent paragraphs should be applied with consider-\nation of all other relevant paragraphs.\n2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is ad-\ndressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others\nwho are involved in medical research involving human subjects\nto adopt these principles.\nGeneral Principles\n3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with\nthe words, “The health of my patient will be my first consider-\nation,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that,\n“A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when provid-\ning medical care.”\n4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the\nhealth, well-being and rights of patients, including those who are\ninvolved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and con-\nscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.\n5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must in-\nclude studies involving human subjects.\n6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human sub-\njects is to understand the causes, development and effects of\ndiseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic in-\nterventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the\nbest proven interventions must be evaluated continually through\nresearch for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility\nand quality.\n7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and\nensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health\nand rights.\n8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new\nknowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights\nand interests of individual research subjects.\n9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research\nto protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-\ndetermination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal informa-\ntion of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection\nof research subjects must always rest with the physician or other\nhealth care professionals and never with the research subjects,\neven though they have given consent.\n10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms\nand standards for research involving human subjects in their own\ncountries as well as applicable international norms and stan-\ndards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory re-\nquirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for\nresearch subjects set forth in this Declaration.\n11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that mini-\nmises possible harm to the environment.\n12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted\nonly by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific edu-\ncation, training and qualifications. Research on patients or\nhealthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and\nappropriately qualified physician or other health care profes-\nsional.\nClinical Review & Education\nSpecial Communication\njama.com JAMA November 27, 2013 Volume 310, Number 20 2191\nCopyright 2013 American Medical Association.

Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should\nbe provided appropriate access to participation in research.\n14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care\nshould involve their patients in research only to the extent that\nthis is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or thera-\npeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that\nparticipation in the research study will not adversely affect the\nhealth of the patients who serve as research subjects.\n15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are\nharmed as a result of participating in research must be en-\nsured.\nRisks, Burdens and Benefits\n16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions\ninvolve risks and burdens.\nMedical research involving human subjects may only be con-\nducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the risks and\nburdens to the research subjects.\n17. All medical research involving human subjects must be pre-\nceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens\nto the individuals and groups involved in the research in com-\nparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individu-\nals or groups affected by the condition under investigation.\nMeasures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks\nmust be continuously monitored, assessed and documented by\nthe researcher.\n18. Physicians may not be involvedin a research study involving hu-\nman subjects unless they are confident that the risks have been\nadequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.\nWhen the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or\nwhen there is conclusive proof of definitive outcomes, physi-\ncians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately\nstop the study.\nVulnerable Groups and Individuals\n19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may\nhave an increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring ad-\nditional harm.\nAll vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifi-\ncally considered protection.\n20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the\nresearch is responsive to the health needs or priorities of this\ngroup and the research cannot be carried out in a non-\nvulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to ben-\nefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result\nfrom the research.\nScientific Requirements and Research Protocols\n21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to gen-\nerally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough\nknowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of\ninformation, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, ani-\nmal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research\nmust be respected.\n22. The design and performance of each research study involving\nhuman subjects must be clearly described and justified in a re-\nsearch protocol.\nThe protocol should contain a statement of the ethical consid-\nerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this\nDeclaration have been addressed. The protocol should include\ninformation regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affilia-\ntions, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and\ninformation regarding provisions for treating and/or compen-\nsating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participa-\ntion in the research study.\nIn clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate ar-\nrangements for post-trial provisions.\nResearch Ethics Committees\n23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, com-\nment, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics\ncommittee before the study begins. This committee must be\ntransparent in its functioning, must be independent of the re-\nsearcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must\nbe duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and\nregulations of the country or countries in which the research is\nto be performed as well as applicable international norms and\nstandards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate\nany of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Dec-\nlaration.\nThe committee must have the right to monitor ongoing stud-\nies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the\ncommittee, especially information about any serious adverse\nevents. No amendment to the protocol may be made without\nconsideration and approval by the committee. After the end of\nthe study, the researchers must submit a final report to the com-\nmittee containing a summary of the study’s findings and con-\nclusions.\nPrivacy and Confidentiality\n24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of re-\nsearch subjects and the confidentiality of their personal infor-\nmation.\nInformed Consent\n25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent\nas subjects in medical research must be voluntary.

All rights reserved.\nmay be appropriate to consult family members or community\nleaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may\nbe enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.\n26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving\ninformed consent, each potential subject must be adequately\ninformed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any pos-\nsible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the re-\nsearcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study\nand the discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any\nother relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must\nbe informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or\nto withdraw consent to participate at any time without repri-\nsal. Special attention should be given to the specific informa-\ntion needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the meth-\nods used to deliver the information.\nAfter ensuring that the potential subject has understood the in-\nformation, the physician or another appropriately qualified in-\ndividual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given in-\nformed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be\nexpressed in writing, the non-written consent must be formally\ndocumented and witnessed.\nAll medical research subjects should be given the option of being\ninformed about the general outcome and results of the study.\n27 . When seeking informed consent for participation in a research\nstudy the physician must be particularly cautious if the poten-\ntial subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or\nmay consent under duress. In such situations the informed con-\nsent must be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who\nis completely independent of this relationship.\n28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving in-\nformed consent, the physician must seek informed consent from\nthe legally authorised representative. These individuals must not\nbe included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit\nfor them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group\nrepresented by the potential subject, the research cannot in-\nstead be performed with persons capable of providing in-\nformed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and\nminimal burden.\n29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of\ngiving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about\nparticipation in research, the physician must seek that assent in\naddition to the consent of the legally authorised representa-\ntive. The potential subject’s dissent should be respected.\n30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally in-\ncapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients,\nmay be done only if the physical or mental condition that pre-\nvents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the\nresearch group. In such circumstances the physician must seek\ninformed consent from the legally authorised representative. If\nno such representative is available and if the research cannot be\ndelayed, the study may proceed without informed consent pro-\nvided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a con-\ndition that renders them unable to give informed consent have\nbeen stated in the research protocol and the study has been ap-\nproved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the\nresearch must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject\nor a legally authorised representative.\n31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their\ncare are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to par-\nticipate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the\nstudy must never adversely affect the patient-physician rela-\ntionship.\n32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data,\nsuch as research on material or data contained in biobanks or\nsimilar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for\nits collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional\nsituations where consent would be impossible or impracti-\ncable to obtain for such research. In such situations the re-\nsearch may be done only after consideration and approval of a\nresearch ethics committee.\nUse of Placebo\n33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new inter-\nvention must be tested against those of the best proven inter-\nvention(s), except in the following circumstances:\nWhere no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no\nintervention, is acceptable; or\nWhere for compelling and scientifically sound methodological\nreasons the use of any intervention less effective than the best\nproven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary\nto determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention\nand the patients who receive any intervention less effective than\nthe best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be sub-\nject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result\nof not receiving the best proven intervention.\nExtreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.\nPost-Trial Provisions\n34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host coun-\ntry governments should make provisions for post-trial access for\nall participants who still need an intervention identified as ben-\neficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to par-\nticipants during the informed consent process.\nResearch Registration and Publication and Dissemination\nof Results\n35. Every research study involving human subjects must be regis-\ntered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the\nfirst subject.\nWorld Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki Special Communication Clinical Review & Education\njama.com JAMA November 27, 2013 Volume 310, Number 20 2193\nCopyright 2013 American Medical Association.

In providing medical care, the physician must respect the dignity, autonomy, and rights of the patient. The\nphysician must respect the patient’s right to freely accept or refuse care in keeping with the patient’s values and\npreferences.\n1\n4. The physician must commit to the primacy of patient health and well-being and must o@er care in the\npatient’s best interests. In doing so, the physician must strive to prevent or minimise harm for the patient and\nseek a positive balance between the intended bene-t to the patient and any potential harm.\n1\n5. The physician must respect the patient’s right to be informed in every phase of the care process. The\nphysician must obtain the patient’s voluntary informed consent prior to any medical care provided, ensuring\nthat the patient receives and understands the information needed to make an independent, informed decision\nabout the proposed care.

If any aspect of caring for the patient is beyond the capacity of a physician, the physician must consult with\nor refer the patient to another appropriately quali-ed physician or health professional who has the necessary\ncapacity.\n2\n1. The physician must ensure accurate and timely medical documentation.\n2\n2. The physician must respect the patient’s privacy and con-dentiality, even after the patient has died. A\nphysician may disclose con-dential information if the patient provides voluntary informed consent or, in\nexceptional cases, when disclosure is necessary to safeguard a signi-cant and overriding ethical obligation to\nwhich all other possible solutions have been exhausted, even when the patient does not or cannot consent to\nit. This disclosure must be limited to the minimal necessary information, recipients, and duration.\n2\n3. If a physician is acting on behalf of or reporting to any third parties with respect to the care of a patient, the\nphysician must inform the patient accordingly at the outset and, where appropriate, during the course of any\ninteractions. The physician must disclose to the patient the nature and extent of those commitments and must\nobtain consent for the interaction.\n2\n4. The physician must refrain from intrusive or otherwise inappropriate advertising and marketing and ensure\nthat all information used by the physician in advertising and marketing is factual and not misleading.\n2\n5. The physician must not allow commercial, -nancial, or other con9icting interests to a@ect the physician’s\nprofessional judgement.\n2\n6. When providing medical care remotely, the physician must ensure that this form of communication is\nmedically justi-able and that the necessary medical care is provided. The physician must also inform the patient\nabout the bene-ts and limitations of receiving medical care remotely, obtain the patient’s consent, and ensure\nthat patient con-dentiality is upheld. Wherever medically appropriate, the physician must aim to provide care\nto the patient through direct, personal contact.\n2\n7. The physician must maintain appropriate professional boundaries.

The physician must never engage in\nabusive, exploitative, or other inappropriate relationships or behaviour with a patient and must not engage in a\nsexual relationship with a current patient.\n2\n8. In order to provide care of the highest standards, physicians must attend to their own health, well-being,\nand abilities. This includes seeking appropriate care to ensure that they are able to practise safely.\n2\n9. This Code represents the physician’s ethical duties. However, on some issues there are profound moral\ndilemmas concerning which physicians and patients may hold deeply considered but con9icting conscientious\nbeliefs.\nT\nhe physician has an ethical obligation to minimise disruption to patient care. Physician conscientious objection\nto provision of any lawful medical interventions may only be exercised if the individual patient is not harmed or\ndiscriminated against and if the patient’s health is not endangered.\nT\nhe physician must immediately and respectfully inform the patient of this objection and of the patient’s right\nto consult another quali-ed physician and provide su3cient information to enable the patient to initiate such a\nconsultation in a timely manner.\nD\nuties to other physicians, health professionals, students, and other personnel\n3\n0. The physician must engage with other physicians, health professionals and other personnel in a respectful\nand collaborative manner without bias, harassment, or discriminatory conduct. The physician must also ensure\nthat ethical principles are upheld when working in teams.\n3\n1. The physician should respect colleagues’ patient-physician relationships and not intervene unless requested\nby either party or needed to protect the patient from harm. This should not prevent the physician from\nrecommending alternative courses of action considered to be in the patient’s best interests.\n3\n2. The physician should report to the appropriate authorities conditions or circumstances which impede the\nphysician or other health professionals from providing care of the highest standards or from upholding the\nprinciples of this Code. This includes any form of abuse or violence against physicians and other health\npersonnel, inappropriate working conditions, or other circumstances that produce excessive and sustained\nlevels of stress.\n3\n3. The physician must accord due respect to teachers and students.\nD\nuties to society\n3\n4. The physician must support fair and equitable provision of health care. This includes addressing inequities\nin health and care, the determinants of those inequities, as well as violations of the rights of both patients and\nhealth professionals.\n3\n5. Physicians play an important role in matters relating to health, health education, and health literacy. In\nful-lling this responsibility, physicians must be prudent in discussing new discoveries, technologies, or\ntreatments in non-professional, public settings, including social media, and should ensure that their own\nstatements are scienti-cally accurate and understandable.\nP\nhysicians must indicate if their own opinions are contrary to evidence-based scienti-c information.\n3\n6. The physician must support sound medical scienti-c research in keeping with the WMA Declaration of\nHelsinki\nand the WMA Declaration of\nTaipei\n.\n3\n7. The physician should avoid acting in such a way as to weaken public trust in the medical profession. To\nmaintain that trust, individual physicians must hold themselves and fellow physicians to the highest standards\nof professional conduct and be prepared to report behaviour that con9icts with the principles of this Code to\nthe appropriate authorities.\n3\n8. The physician should share medical knowledge and expertise for the bene-t of patients and the\nadvancement of health care, as well as public and global health.\nD\nuties as a member of the medical profession\n3\n9. The physician should follow, protect, and promote the ethical principles of this Code. The physician should\nhelp prevent national or international ethical, legal, organisational, or regulatory requirements that undermine\nany of the duties set forth in this Code.\n4\n0. The physician should support fellow physicians in upholding the responsibilities set out in this Code and\ntake measures to protect them from undue in9uence, abuse, exploitation, violence, or oppression.",
